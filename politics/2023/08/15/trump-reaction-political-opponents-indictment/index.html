        <p>Former President Donald Trump’s fourth indictment late Monday drew condemnation and consolation from his opponents in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.</p> <p>Conservative entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy weighed in even before the Georgia events unfolded, describing the anticipated charges against the frontrunner in the GOP race as “another disastrous Trump indictment” after the Fulton County court where Trump was later charged appeared to post and then remove a document detailing the impending indictment.</p> <p>Ramaswamy went beyond attacking the Georgia prosecutors bringing the charges, suggesting he’d be willing to assist in the former president’s legal defense.</p> <p>“As someone who’s running for President against Trump, I’d volunteer to write the amicus brief to the court myself: prosecutors should not be deciding U.S. presidential elections, and if they’re so overzealous that they commit constitutional violations, then the cases should be thrown out &amp; they should be held accountable," Ramaswamy wrote on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis denounced the indictment during a call with New England media outlets, promising to “end the weaponization of federal agencies like the DOJ and FBI.”</p> <p>“I think it’s an example of this criminalization of politics,” DeSantis said. “I don’t think this is something that’s good for the country.”<p><p>Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson was not so sympathetic, instead reiterating his calls for Trump to drop out of the race.</p> <p>“Over a year ago, I said that Donald Trump’s actions disqualified him from ever serving as President again. Those words are more true today than ever before,” Hutchinson wrote on X late Monday, following the news of the indictment.</p> <p>Trump’s latest charges, leveled by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis after a two-year investigation, include allegations that he conspired to derail the Electoral College process, and pressured Georgia officials to undo the election results all while lying about fraud allegations.</p> <p>Another Trump critic, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, tacked a slightly different path. A former U.S. attorney, he dinged Willis for what he characterized as an “ego” move, given that the former president already faced charges for election interference at the federal level.</p> <p>“I think the double charging here of Donald Trump is just something that complicates things in a way that makes the administration of justice much more difficult in the near term. I didn’t think it was a necessary thing to do, once you saw Jack Smith was charging him for him federally for the very same conduct,” Christie told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Tuesday afternoon, referring to the special counsel overseeing the federal investigation. “I’m a little bit concerned that this had more to do with ego than anything else.”</p> <p>But Christie said that the former president’s conduct was still “disturbing” and that Willis brought a permissible case under the racketeering law that Trump and his co-defendants face charges on.</p> <p>In some ways, the Georgia case does put Trump in a tighter legal bind. If elected president again, he might try to pardon himself on the federal charges or have those cases dismissed, but he would not have the jurisdiction to free himself from the Georgia state charges.</p> <p>Former Rep. Will Hurd of Texas said on Tuesday that “it’s time to move beyond dealing with the former president’s baggage.”</p> <p>“Another day, another indictment, and another example of how the former president’s baggage will hand Joe Biden reelection if Trump is the nominee,” Hurd said. “This is further evidence that Trump knew he lost the 2020 election and was ready to do anything it took to cling to power. He will use this latest indictment as another opportunity to manipulate Americans into paying his legal bills.”<p><p>Leaders in Congress were quick to deliver what have become consistent responses in the wake of news of Trump’s growing legal woes.</p> <p>“The actions taken by the Fulton County District Attorney, along with other state and federal prosecutors, reaffirms the shared belief that in America no one, not even the president, is above the law,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a joint statement with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday night.</p> <p>Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), who chaired the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and the events leading up to it, wrote: “The January 6th Select Committee revealed that Donald Trump and his allies used the Big Lie of a stolen election to pressure Georgia public servants to betray their oaths and manipulate the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election.”&nbsp;</p> <p>House Speaker Kevin McCarthy accused President Joe Biden of weaponizing the government against Trump, and attacked Willis, claiming she brought the indictment in an effort “to fundraise her political career.”</p> <p>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) also came to the former president’s defense.</p> <p>“Today’s indictment is just the latest political attack in the Democrats’ WITCH HUNT against President Trump,” Jordan, who heads the House Judiciary Committee wrote on X. “He did nothing wrong!”</p> <p><i>Kierra Frazier and Andrew Zhang contributed to this report.</i><p>
