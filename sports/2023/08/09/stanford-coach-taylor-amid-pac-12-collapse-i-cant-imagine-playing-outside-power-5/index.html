    <p>STANFORD – As the Stanford football team walked off the field following practice Tuesday night, one of the players saw the assembled media members and shouted “We’re going Independent!”</p>
<p>He quickly announced he was kidding, but it was a nod to the program’s uncertain future after five Pac-12 teams announced last week that they were leaving the conference after the 2023-24 season, leaving only Stanford, Cal, Washington State and Oregon State.</p>
<p>Cardinal coach Troy Taylor didn’t know where the team would end up, but he was confident it would work out.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of faith that we have an incredible brand at Stanford and we’ll land somewhere really good,” Taylor said. “Just looking forward to finding out where it is, just like you guys.”</p>
<p>The reported possibilities for the football team range from joining an existing conference such as the ACC or Mountain West, staying in the Pac-12 by adding teams, or going Independent like Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Taylor said that it was important that Stanford stay in a major conference.</p>
<p>“The players that are committed to us to come here, they want to play Power 5 football and that&#8217;s what our intention is at this university,” Taylor said. “I can&#8217;t imagine anything else.”</p>
<p>That might mean long flights to most road games, especially in a conference like the ACC, but Taylor said he didn’t mind.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m OK with travel,” Taylor said. “If you&#8217;ve got to travel a little more, that means when they come play us, they have to travel.</p>
<p>“People used to have to come across the country in covered wagons. It would take a month and they’d be completely different people by the time they got here. We get on a plane for five or six hours, that’s not the end of the world. Get drinks served to you and snacks. It’s not that bad.”</p>
<p>Senior running back Casey Filkins, the 2019 Oregon Gatorade Player of the Year, said he was looking forward to potentially the final Pac-12 games against the two schools from his home state. He has seen a lot of discussion on social media and learned to wait for official word from schools and conferences.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s obviously a trip thinking about how college football was starting to really change and you know, I think the NIL landscape obviously is a big area (of change),&#8221; he said. &#8220;And now this conference realignment stuff, I still think even five or 10 years from now, it can look a lot different than it does right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>EJ Smith, a senior who started ahead of Filkins last year before injury, said his mind is on what he can control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pac 12 is running wild, just with everybody leaving and stuff like that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But right now, I&#8217;m just focused on the season.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, the uncertainty has yet to impact Stanford’s 2024 recruiting class, which is ranked 19th nationally by 247Sports. No one from the class has publicly re-opened his recruitment yet.</p>
<p>“People want to hear what&#8217;s going on and I tell them to just be patient, and hopefully we&#8217;ll come to some resolution,” Taylor said. “You know, I don&#8217;t have the answers for them at this point. But like I said, they trust the brand, it’s why they chose Stanford, and we’ll end up in a good place, I really believe that. Wish it was in the Pac-12. Sorry to see that end. But you know, as a coach and player, you move forward quickly.”</p>

<p>Still, Taylor said he was disappointed that the Pac-12 he grew up with is no longer viable. Taylor was the all-time leading passer at Cal when he graduated in 1989, and spent another four years there as an assistant coach. He was also the offensive coordinator at Utah in 2017 and 2018.</p>
<p>But there’s no time for nostalgia now. In a sport where games are scheduled 10 years in advance, Stanford suddenly doesn’t know what opponents it will face next year.</p>
<p>Taylor said he isn’t involved in conversations about potential landing spots. Still, he hopes that the same qualities that drew him to Stanford as its head coach in December are enough to make it appealing to a major conference.</p>
<p>“People know Stanford, they respect Stanford, and in spite of maybe a couple of mediocre rough years in football, Stanford&#8217;s been a really good football team in the past,&#8221; Taylor said. “I think it&#8217;s short-sighted to look at the last couple of years. We&#8217;re gonna have a really good football program. We’re going to win championships in whatever conference we’re in. And I think people realize the draw of Stanford, not just as a program, but also academically.”</p>
