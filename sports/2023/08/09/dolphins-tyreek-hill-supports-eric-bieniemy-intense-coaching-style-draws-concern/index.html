    <p>Eric Bieniemy is preparing for his first season as offensive coordinator of the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/washington-commanders" target="_blank"><u>Washington Commanders</u></a>, and his coaching style appears to have required some adjustment by members of his new team. </p> <p>Commanders head coach Ron Rivera said Tuesday that some Commanders players are "a little concerned" about <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/eric-bieniemys-intense-coaching-style-draws-concerns-some-commanders-players-ron-rivera-says" target="_blank"><u>Bieniemy's intensity</u></a> level. Rivera did not name specific players who might have concerns.</p> <p>Bieniemy, who helped steer the Kansas City Chiefs to two Super Bowls in five years as offensive coordinator, found support from outside the organization, as Miami Dolphins wide receiver <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dolphins-tyreek-hill-resolves-dispute-man-accused-assaulting-marina" target="_blank"><u>Tyreek Hill</u></a> hopped on social media to back Bieniemy. </p>  <p>"Man there is no other coach that has your back like EB !! Take that coaching and get better we all been through … it’s tough but I promise you it will make you better," Hill posted to X. </p> <p>Hill spent the first six years of his career with Bieniemy in Kansas City before being traded to the Dolphins prior to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl" target="_blank"><u>2022 NFL season</u></a>. </p>  <p>"I mean, it's a whole different approach. Again, you're getting a different kind of player from the players back in the past, especially in light of how things are coming out of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa-fb" target="_blank"><u>college football</u></a>," Rivera said, according to NFL.com. "So a lot of these young guys, they do struggle with certain things and a lot of it ... is from where they've been. </p> <p>"I mean, guys coming from certain programs are used to it. Guys coming from other programs aren't as much. So, us as a coach, I kind of have to assimilate and get a feel for everybody. Eric has an approach and it's the way he does things and it's not going to change because he believes in it."</p> <p>Bieniemy was hired in February in order to help an offense that has failed to finish better than 20th in the league in Rivera’s three years as head coach. </p> <p>The Commanders are hoping second-year quarterback Sam Howell is the answer under center after a revolving door at the position in the past few years. </p> <p>"Eric Bieniemy is who he is. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/commanders-oc-eric-bieniemy-says-focus-on-job-at-hand-head-coaching-not-in-thought-process" target="_blank"><u>Eric Bieniemy</u></a> knows how to adapt and adjust," Bieniemy said. "Eric Bieniemy is a tough, hard-nosed coach. But also understand, I'm going to be their biggest and harshest critic, but I'm also their No. 1 fan because I've got their back and I'm gonna support them at all times."</p> <p><i>Fox News’ Chantz Martin contributed to this report</i></p>
