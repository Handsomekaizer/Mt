    <p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am is cutting its field nearly in half and eliminating one of the three courses, part of the price to become a signature event with a $20 million purse in a revamped 2024 schedule the PGA Tour released Monday.</p>
<p>Pebble Beach replaces the Phoenix Open as a signature event, which was expected. What it gave up was the 156-man field, each with a prominent amateur, playing Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Monterey Peninsula over 54 holes before a cut to the final round.</p>
<p>Next year Pebble Beach will have 80 players and 80 amateurs competing for 36 holes at Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill, with only the pros advancing to the weekend at Pebble Beach.</p>
<p>The tournament will be held Feb. 1-4.</p>
<p>“Needless to say, we are thrilled,” said Steve John, CEO of the Monterey Peninsula Foundation, which is the host organization for the event.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement from the Foundation, it thanked title sponsor AT&amp;T and the Pebble Beach Company.</p>
<p><br />
“… Monterey Peninsula Foundation remains committed to its 80-year history of supporting nonprofits across Monterey, Santa Cruz and San Benito counties,” the statement said. John confirmed the Foundation would remain the host organization.</p>
<p>The AT&amp;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am began in 1937 as the Bing Crosby Pro-Am with Crosby and his friends gathering for golf and festivities in Rancho Santa Fe in San Diego County. It moved to the Monterey Peninsula in 1947 after a four-year WWII hiatus.</p>
<p>It was called “The Clambake” and its transfer to the Peninsula was the result of a suggestion of Ted Durein, The Herald’s former sports editor. Crosby, a member of Cypress Point Club, agreed to move the tournament to the Peninsula to support area businesses. It has been known for its participating celebrities, including Crosby, Dean Martin and, most recently, Bill Murray.</p>
<p>Since its Central Coast debut, the tournament has been played on six different courses and it has had five official names. Its current title sponsor arrived in 1986.</p>
<p>Next season, Monterey Peninsula Country Club, which joined the three-course rotation in 2012, will be eliminated. The tournament will remain at Spyglass Hill Golf Course and Pebble Beach Golf Links. The latter has been the host course since 1947.</p>
<p>Justin Rose ended a four-year PGA Tour drought to win the 2023 AT&amp;T. It included only three of the top 20 and 21 of the world’s top 100 players. He earned $1.62 million of the $9 million purse.</p>
<p>The LIV Tour held its first tournament beginning on June 9, 2022. The circuit attracted some of golf’s most prominent players with multi-million contracts, three-round events, no cuts and guaranteed tournament earnings.</p>

<p>Phil Mickelson, among the most popular players at the AT&amp;T and a record-tying five-time winner, quickly departed the PGA Tour for LIV.</p>
<p>Besides Mickelson, two-time AT&amp;T winner Dustin Johnson and top-level veterans Paul Casey, Bryson DeChambeau, Sergio Garcia, Brooks Koepka, Graeme McDowell, Kevin Na, Patrick Reed and Bubba Watson, all departed the PGA Tour for LIV and received lucrative amounts to do so. They’ve all been banned from the PGA Tour, but are expected to be welcomed back in an impending merger of LIV and the PGA Tour.</p>
<h3>Other events</h3>
<p>Next year’s PGA Tour signature events, with fields between 70 and 80 players, will not have a 36-hole cut except for the three player-hosted invitationals — the Genesis Invitational at Riviera (Tiger Woods), the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill and the Memorial (Jack Nicklaus).</p>
<p>Those will cut to the low 50 and ties and anyone within 10 shots of the lead. The invitationals also will award $4 million to the winner — equal to the payoff at LIV Golf — compared with $3.6 million for the winner at the other five signature events.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour returns to a calendar year — January through August — for the first time since 2013. The AT&amp;T will be the fifth event of the season. And while only the prize funds for the signature events were announced, top players can expect to make more money than ever.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour also attempted to spread out the limited-field, signature events and did that with few exceptions. The Phoenix Open will be Feb. 8-11 — one week after Pebble Beach, one week before the Genesis Invitational at Riviera. Phoenix prefers to end on Super Bowl Sunday and has generated its own level of loud over the years with its raucous party scene.</p>
<p>But that means moving the Memorial off Memorial Day, putting it one week before the U.S. Open. It’s the start of three straight weeks, concluding with the Travelers Championship.</p>
<p>The signature events also allow room for players to qualify. They are for the top 50 in the FedEx Cup standings this year, which will be determined after the FedEx St. Jude Invitational this week at the TPC Southwind.</p>
<p>Players will have incentive to play in the fall if they miss out because Nos. 51-60 at the end of the fall schedule will be exempt into Pebble Beach and Riviera. After that, the top 10 players available in the current FedEx Cup standings will get in the $20 million events.</p>
<p>There also is room for five players who lead a special points list from the tournaments between signature events.</p>
<p>The season starts Jan. 4 at Kapalua with the Sentry Tournament of Champions and ends Sept. 1 with the Tour Championship, a week later than usual because of the Olympics in France. Kapalua, previously a winners-only start to the year, now has the top 50 from the FedEx Cup.</p>
<p>The other signatures events are Kapalua, RBC Heritage at Hilton Head; the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow; and the Travelers Championship in Connecticut.</p>
<p>The Travelers has a long history of awarding exemptions to rising amateurs and recent college graduates. Now its limited field is restricted to the FedEx Cup standings and four exemptions for PGA Tour members.</p>
<p>Nathan Grube, the tournament director, said the Travelers wants to keep its reputation of giving young players an exemption.</p>
<p>“The young players are part of our DNA,” Grube said Monday. “No, the exemption process won’t be like it was. But we are going to figure out a way to keep a relationship with the young guys that are out there.”</p>
<p>The tour also has five opposite-field events, adding stops in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina (the same week as Quail Hollow). It has yet to name a title sponsor for the event previously held in Kentucky, along with a title sponsor for what had been the Honda Classic.</p>
