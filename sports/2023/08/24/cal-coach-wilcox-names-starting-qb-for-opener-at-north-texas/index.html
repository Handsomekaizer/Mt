    <p>BERKELEY — Sam Jackson V, announced Thursday as Cal’s starting quarterback, wasn’t feeling good about things early this month as fall camp began.</p>
<p>So he sat down with new offensive coordinator Jake Spavital to get a road map to the starting job.</p>
<p>“I had a rough start to fall camp,” Jackson said. “They just told me they wanted me to play quarterback.”</p>
<p>Specifically, Spavital instructed the redshirt sophomore transfer from TCU to stay in the pocket, go through his progressions and make the right play. Every snap didn’t have to lead to a home run.</p>
<p>“That was the biggest jump I’ve made,” Jackson said. “Honestly, I was pretty uncomfortable at the beginning because I’ve really never done it.</p>
<p>“My high school films show me just scrambling around. I was just playing backyard football in high school. There were some growing pains with it but it’s helped me feel more confident.”</p>
<p>Jackson got the nod over North Carolina State transfer Ben Finley and redshirt freshman Fernando Mendoza, the team’s only quarterback who was on the roster a year ago. Coach Justin Wilcox said the competition was intense and that no decision has been made on a No. 2.</p>

<p>He also stressed that the Bears have no plans to use two quarterbacks when they open their season Sept. 2 at North Texas.</p>
<p>“Sam’s the starter and we want to get him out there and get him into a rhythm,” Wilcox said. “We have confidence in all those guys but Sam has earned the right to start and we’re excited to watch him grow with this opportunity.”</p>
<p>Jackson has thrown just six passes as a college quarterback — completing all of them — and played just one season at the position in high school. He was a wide receiver as a sophomore at Naperville Central High near Chicago, moved to quarterback as a junior then had his senior season canceled because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Asked if he expects to be a better player in a couple months than he is now, Jackson was adamant.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll be much better,” he said. “Even from spring to fall I was much better with my pocket presence and being decisive. Most of it comes from reps just because I haven’t played that much.”</p>
<p>But Spavital, whose preference was having a dual-threat quarterback to operate his fast-paced spread offense, said Jackson did enough over the past couple weeks to show he is deserving of the assignment.</p>
<p>“I really thought the last 10 practices, roughly, I saw a light kind of click for him. I thought he did a really good job of moving the ball,” Spavital said.</p>
<p>Spavital noted Jackson’s play in the first of the team’s two summer scrimmages, where he converted third-down plays with runs that earned first downs. And he didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>“What really separated Sam was he ended up getting into the end zone probably like 15 more times than the other guys,” Spavital said.</p>
<p>Jackson got the news from Spavital on Tuesday, and was ecstatic.</p>

<p>“Obviously, I’m very excited to hear I won the starting job,” he said. “I really appreciate the coaches for letting me build that trust with them.”</p>
<p>He said he phoned his father, Sam Jackson IV, and the two talked for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>“He was pretty excited,” Jackson said. “It’s pretty much been a long journey for us.”</p>
<p>Jackson said he expects his father and mother and other mentors and coaches will all make the trip to Texas in a week.</p>
<p>“I think I’m going to have to get a lot of tickets for the game,” he said.</p>
