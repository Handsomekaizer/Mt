    <p><em>Welcome back to the Bay Area News Group’s high school football roundup.</em></p>
<p><em> Here, you&#8217;ll find all the details from the weekend’s action in this news organization&#8217;s coverage area, which encompasses teams that play in leagues based primarily in Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.</em></p>

<p><em>On to the roundup &#8230;</em></p>
<h3>Ranked teams</h3>
<h3>Orange Lutheran 35, No. 2 De La Salle 14</h3>
<p>Tied at halftime, De La Salle gave up three unanswered second-half touchdowns and lost at home against an opponent that comes from the same league that features Mater Dei and St. John Bosco. <strong>Steve Chavez</strong> was the star of stars for Orange Lutheran, rushing for three touchdowns, including one justifiably called “Beast Mode 3.0” by the junior running back&#8217;s coaches. <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/25/de-la-salle-fades-in-second-half-loses-its-season-opener-to-orange-lutheran/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Darren Sabedra has the complete story here.</em></a></p>
<h3><b>No. 4 Clayton Valley 17, Salinas 0</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Playing their first game under new coach </span><b>Nick Tisa</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Ugly Eagles showed off a stout defense for the entire contest and finally got their offense rolling in the fourth quarter with two touchdowns. The game was scoreless until </span><b>Will Carranza</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> kicked a 31-yard field goal midway through the third quarter, giving Clayton Valley all the points it would need. Salinas, which was 10-2 last season and beat the Uglies in Concord, threatened to come right back in the fourth period, driving to the CV 30. But </span><b>Nathan Underwood</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> intercepted a pass to end that drive. The CV offense took control from there, driving 80 yards. Quarterback </span><b>Mason Lovett</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> capped the drive with a 45-yard touchdown pass to </span><b>Tony Keck</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> to make it 10-0 Clayton Valley with about nine minutes to go. The Cowboys drove into CV territory on their ensuing possession, but they missed a field goal, and Lovett scampered 5 yards for another TD with a minute left. Tisa has been CV’s co-head coach with Tim Murphy for the last few years, but he hadn’t been the sole head coach since he left Dougherty Valley after the 2017 season. He coached the Wildcats for six years. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">– Mike Lefkow</span></i></p>
<h3><b>No. 5 San Ramon Valley 42, No. 8 St. Ignatius 14</b></h3>
<p><b>Luke Baker</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, last season&#8217;s Bay Area News Group player of the year, completed 19 of 25 passes for 307 yards in a rout at St. Ignatius. Junior WR </span><b>Owen Scott</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> had eight receptions for 133 yards, including a 65-yard touchdown. SI’s </span><b>Pierce St. Geme</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> scored on a 34-yard run to tie the game at seven apiece early, but SRV ran off 21 unanswered points to pull away.  </span><em><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/25/luke-baker-shines-in-san-ramon-valleys-dominant-win-in-season-opener/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Madeline Kenney was in San Francisco and has the full story</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400"><em>.</em> </span></p>
<h3><span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">Helix-La Mesa 45, No. 6 St. Francis 21</span></h3>
<p><span class="c-mrkdwn__highlight">St. Francis</span> opened the game with a three-and-out and a quick touchdown on the ground, but Helix responded with 25 unanswered first-half points to roll to a win. <em>Alex Simon was in Mountain View and has the story here.</em></p>

</ul>
<h3>No. 7 Los Gatos 45, Soquel 14</h3>
<p><strong>AJ Minyard</strong> had quite the night leading the Wildcats to a season-opening victory at home over Soquel on Thursday. The senior completed 16 of 21 passes for 249 yards and five touchdowns as Los Gatos put the game away in the second half after a competitive opening two quarters. <strong>Scott Garwood</strong> caught three TD passes and <strong>Jaylen Thomas</strong> reeled in two. <em>Check out Darren Sabedra&#8217;s game story here.</em></p>
<h3><b>No. 10 Valley Christian 16, No. 9 Wilcox 15</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The matchup between CCS powers did not disappoint, with </span><b>Aaron VanderVeen’s</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> third-quarter field goal for Valley being the game-winner in a defensive struggle. Last year’s WCAL RB of the year </span><b>Uchenna Eke</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> ran for 54 yards, and four-star WR</span><b> Kai Hamilton</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> had 48 receiving yards for VC. </span><b>Tyson Bonilla</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><b>Elijah Walker</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> combined to rush for 201 yards for Wilcox. <em>Glenn Reeves has the full report from San Jose.</em></span></p>
<h3>No. 13 Riordan 36, No. 12 Sacred Heart Prep 17</h3>
<p>Riordan scored on its first three possessions and had a 33-3 lead at halftime. <strong>Michael Mitchell Jr.</strong> threw an 85-yard touchdown pass to <strong>Chris Lawson</strong> and a 34-yarder to <strong>Tyrone Jackson</strong>. Freshman <strong>Isi Tuugamusu</strong> scored on the ground. Sacred Heart Prep got second-half rushing touchdowns from <strong>Greg Gamitian</strong> and <strong>Ravu Savail</strong>. Riordan plays at Moreau Catholic on Friday. SHP hosts Sacred Cathedral on Saturday. <em>&#8212; Glenn Reeves</em></p>
<h3><b>No. 14 El Cerrito 14, Amador Valley 7</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">El Cerrito got an immediate impact from senior <strong>Micah Avery</strong> when the Clayton Valley transfer scored on a 69-yard run in the first quarter. Senior QB <strong>Michael Vanhook</strong> added a rushing TD in the second to give El Cerrito a two-score lead. Amador Valley&#8217;s <strong>Aiden Foley</strong> connected with<strong> Nate Jetter</strong> for a six-yard TD with five minutes to go to cut the Gauchos&#8217; lead to seven. </span><em><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/25/el-cerrito-uses-proven-formula-in-season-opening-win-over-division-i-school/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Curtis Pashelka has the full story from Pleasanton</span></a>.</em></p>
<h3><b>No. 15 Liberty 49, Enochs-Modesto 3</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Lions led 42-0 at halftime in their season opener on the road Thursday. </span><b>Jaxon Bell</b><span style="font-weight: 400">, the younger brother of last year’s star quarterback Nate Bell, had three touchdown runs. Receiver </span><b>Ryan</b> <b>McKendry</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> caught a 25-yard TD pass and ran the opening kickoff back for six points. Liberty has started each of the past two seasons against the Eagles (1-1) and has outscored them 105-3. Enochs is a relatively new school that began playing football in 2007. It has had only three seasons above .500. Liberty will go from one extreme to the other in quality of opponent next Friday when it kicks off its home schedule against Los Gatos.<em> – Mike Lefkow</em></span></p>
<h3>No. 16 Campolindo 29, Vanden-Fairfield 23 (2OT)</h3>
<p>In a wild game in Fairfield, <strong>Joe Revelos</strong> caught a 17-yard touchdown pass with 1:29 left to pull Campo (1-0) even. The home team reached the Campo 30 in the final seconds before time expired, sending the game to overtime. In OT, both teams started possessions at the opponent&#8217;s 25-yard line rather than the 10. &#8220;There was much confusion on the overtime ruling,&#8221; Campo coach Kevin Macy said. &#8220;It was explained differently a couple of times.&#8221; <strong>Max Robeson&#8217;s</strong> 15-yard TD pass to <strong>Scott Lyon</strong> put Campo on top in OT. But the extra point was blocked. Vanden (1-1) answered with <strong>Marcellus Chandler&#8217;s</strong> touchdown reception but a bobbled snap prevented what would have been the game-ending extra point. Vanden was stopped on the first series of the second OT &#8212; one of numerous red-zone stops by Campo&#8217;s defense &#8212; and the visitors ended the game as Lyon kept Campo&#8217;s possession alive with a fourth-down reception to the 8-yard line and <strong>Tim Daugherty</strong> followed with a &#8220;Jet Sweep&#8221; run for the walk-off touchdown. &#8220;Complete madness,&#8221; Macy told the Bay Area News Group. &#8220;Our coaches agree that it was the strangest game we have ever been a part of. The defense was incredible.&#8221; <strong>James Giordani</strong> led Campo&#8217;s defense with an interception and numerous tackles.<em> &#8212; Darren Sabedra</em></p>
<h3>San Marin 27, No. 17 Acalanes 20</h3>
<p>The visiting Dons led 14-10 at halftime on a pair of touchdown passes by <strong>Sully Bailey</strong>, but defending CIF State 4A champ San Marin scored 14 unanswered points in the third quarter and never relinquished the lead. Bailey connected on passes of 13 yards to <strong>Henry Souza</strong> and 12 yards to Cal-bound <strong>Trevor Rogers</strong>, both in the second quarter, putting Acalanes on top 14-3. San Marin stormed back to go in front 24-14 after three periods, but the Dons trimmed the lead to 24-20 with four minutes left when Bailey threw his third TD of the night, this one to <strong>Paul Kuhner</strong> from 26 yards out. After a field goal increased San Marin’s lead by three, Acalanes had one last chance to score, getting the ball back with 1:02 left, but San Marin’s defense held for the hard-fought victory. <em>&#8212;</em><em> Mike Lefkow</em></p>
<h3><b>No. 23 Archbishop Mitty 20, No. 18 James Logan 12</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Junior WR/DB </span><b>Alec Grimaldo’s</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> 60-yard onside-kick return for a touchdown keyed Mitty&#8217;s crazy cross-section victory on the road over James Logan. Mitty&#8217;s </span><b>AJ Cenizal</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> rushed for 63 yards and a touchdown, and </span><b>Joey Campagna</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> threw for 179 yards and a TD. James Logan quarterback</span><b> Jonathan Craft</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> threw for two touchdowns and rushed for 73 yards. <em>Joseph Dycus has the </em></span><em><a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/25/mitty-still-gritty-in-wild-season-opening-victory-over-james-logan/"><span style="font-weight: 400">full story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></em></p>
<h3>No. 19 Christopher 23, North Monterey County 13</h3>
<p><strong>Jaxen Robinson</strong> passed for 255 yards and two touchdowns and <strong>Amari Bluford</strong>, <strong>Jaxon Mundorff</strong> and <strong>Matthew Boles</strong> each had an interception on defense as Christopher, playing at home in Gilroy on Thursday, turned back North Monterey County. Bluford was also dynamic on offense, catching six passes for 166 yards and two touchdowns for a team projected to win the Blossom Valley Athletic League Mt. Hamilton Division. The Cougars also got 10 tackles and a sack from strong safety <strong>Evan Vernon</strong>. &#8220;North Monterey County was very tough,&#8221; Christopher coach Darren Yafai said. &#8220;Big, veteran team. They will win a bunch of games and contend for their league.&#8221; Christopher travels to Piedmont Hills next Friday. <em>&#8212; Darren Sabedra</em></p>
<h3><strong>Bellarmine 17, No. 20 Menlo-Atherton 14</strong></h3>
<p>Bellarmine&#8217;s David Diaz-Infante leaned on senior quarterback <strong>Parker Threatt</strong> to win his first game as the Bells&#8217; coach. Threatt ran for a 23-yard TD, and running back <strong>Reece McKeever</strong> also rushed for 113 yards on 29 carries. Menlo-Atherton&#8217;s 6-foot-7 TE <strong>Alek Marshall</strong> caught eight passes for 95 yards and one touchdown to lead M-A&#8217;s late rally. <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2023/08/26/high-school-football-bellarmine-holds-off-late-menlo-atherton-charge-to-pull-out-win/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>David Kiefer has the complete story from San Jose</em></a>.</p>
<h3>No. 21 Monte Vista 42, Granada 3</h3>
<p>All during the off-season there was speculation Monte Vista would be much-improved after last year’s dreadful 2-8 record under first-year coach Johnny Millard. One game doesn’t make a season, but the Mustangs certainly sent a message with their convincing win over the Matadors and talented QB <strong>Quinn Boyd</strong>. Three-star RB <strong>Julian McMahan</strong> ran for 153 yards and two touchdowns, QB <strong>Brayden Turner</strong> completed 15 of 18 passes for 203 yards and three scores, and receivers <strong>Luke Claussen</strong> and <strong>Brandon Breedlove</strong> combined for nine catches. Claussen scored two TDs and Breedlove had six receptions. The hard-driving Mustangs led 28-3 at the half. On the defensive side, LB <strong>Talan Jones</strong>, a two-star recruit, had nine tackles including two for lost yardage, forced a fumble and recovered a fumble. Millard said Granada moved the ball at times but the Mustangs stiffened up in the red zone to prevent any touchdowns. <em>&#8212; Mike Lefkow</em></p>
<h3>Leland 40, No. 24 Half Moon Bay 7</h3>
<p>In perhaps the most stunning result of the night, Leland &#8212; which went 2-8 last season &#8212; went on the road and routed traditionally strong Half Moon Bay. The Chargers scored 14 points in the first quarter and 13 more in the second period to take a 27-0 lead into halftime. The visitors scored the final 13 points in the fourth quarter. <strong>Brady Hernandez</strong> threw a touchdown pass to <strong>Luke Whitson</strong> and also ran for a touchdown to lead Leland. The Chargers also got one rushing touchdown apiece from <strong>Diego Vasquez</strong>, <strong>Jack Christensen</strong> and <strong>Jordan Visperas</strong> as they avenged a 35-9 loss at home to Half Moon Bay in 2022. Leland plays host to Palo Alto on Friday. Half Moon Bay returns to the field Thursday at San Mateo. <em>&#8212; Darren Sabedra</em></p>
<h3>No. 25 Live Oak 53, Gilroy 0</h3>
<p><strong>Luke Newell</strong>, in his first varsity start, completed 5 of 6 passes for 119 yards and one touchdown in the rout over traditional rival Gilroy on Thursday. <strong>Josh Gagne</strong> carried 16 times for 118 yards and two touchdowns. <strong>Kieton Dietz</strong> had two catches for 68 yards and a TD, and made 10 tackles and an interception playing linebacker, The Acorns are at Mountain View on Friday. Gilroy plays at Carmel on Saturday. <em>&#8212; Glenn Reeves</em></p>
<h3>East Bay</h3>
<h3>Antioch 41, Arroyo 8</h3>
<p>The Panthers scored all 41 points in the first half. Antioch’s scoring was fast and furious. <strong>Yusef Jenkins</strong> got the fun started by returning the opening kickoff for a touchdown. QB <strong>Larenzo Mayfield</strong> then threw a 25-yard pass to <strong>Keon Fosselman</strong> to make it 13-0 Panthers. <strong>Elijah Stingley</strong> had two touchdown runs including one of 35 yards, Mayfield also had a TD run and <strong>Roshaud Bartlow</strong> scooped up a fumble and took it to the house. The entire second half was played with a running clock. <em>&#8212; Mike Lefkow</em></p>
<h3>College Park 14, Fremont-Oakland 0</h3>
<p>Host Fremont forfeited in the second quarter because of fights between spectators. Before the game was called, College Park coach Casey Moreno said RB Hunter Pelayo and QB Jimmy Voorhies were playing well for College Park. Four-star linebacker Naki Tuakoi had eight tackles and a forced fumble for Fremont. College Park travels to Oakmont-Roseville next Friday, and Fremont plays at American Canyon. <em>&#8212; Joseph Dycus</em></p>
<h3>Heritage 28, Foothill 25 (OT)</h3>
<p><strong>Emanuel Rankins</strong> scored from 2 yards out in overtime to lead the Patriots over a valiant Foothill squad. Heritage trailed 22-7 heading into the fourth quarter, the Patriots’ only score to that point being <strong>JJ Kinnaird</strong>’s 100-yard dash with the game’s opening kickoff. Fourth-quarter touchdowns by Rankins and Kinnaird enabled Heritage to knot the score. Trailing 22-14, quarterback <strong>Austin Peters</strong> connected with Kinnaird to make it a two-point game, then they hooked up again with the 2-point conversion. Foothill drew first blood in overtime on a 30-yard field goal by <strong>Matt Fields</strong> that made it 25-22. Heritage then got the ball back for one last shot. Faced with a fourth-and-14 at the Foothill 17-yard line, Peters threw a 15-yard completion to <strong>Charlie Blaise</strong> that brought the ball to the 2. From there, Rankins ran in the winning score. <em>&#8212; Mike Lefkow</em></p>
<h3>Las Lomas 34, Vintage 22</h3>
<p>Sophomore QB <strong>Dylan Thomas</strong> threw three first-half touchdown passes, as the host Knights coasted to a surprisingly easy win. Two of Thomas’ TD tosses went to <strong>Roman Mercado</strong>. He connected with 6-foot-3 junior wideout <strong>Colby Cooley</strong> for another six points. <strong>Kaden Lagaya</strong> scored on a 3-yard run. All four Las Lomas touchdowns came in the first half as the Knights built a 28-7 lead at intermission. <strong>Daniel Soccol</strong> kicked two second-half field goals to complete the scoring for the winners. The game was never really in doubt, with Vintage scoring a touchdown and 2-point conversion with four minutes left for the final margin. <em>&#8212; Mike Lefkow</em></p>
<h3><b>Miramonte 28, Berkeley 12</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miramonte played three quarterbacks in its season opener as it tries to find a successor for Luke Duncan, now at UCLA. However, coach Jack Schram said </span><b>Carson Blair</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> was stellar during a third quarter in which the Matadors pulled away from a talented Berkeley team. Berkeley’s defense played well, with </span><b>BJ Thurman</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> returning an interception for a touchdown and </span><b>Shawn Brown</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> returning a fumble for a TD. <strong>PJ Mataafa</strong> led Berkeley with 85 rushing yards. Next Friday, the Matadors (1-0) host Piedmont and Berkeley (0-1) plays at Casa Grande. &#8212; <em>Joseph Dycus</em></span></p>
<h3>Pierce 33, Piedmont 21</h3>
<p>In its first game since the program stopped its season midway through the 2022 season, the Highlanders went on the road and gave Pierce a competitive game. Junior QB <strong>Markos Lagios</strong> connected with WR <strong>Sam Shelby</strong> for a 60-yard touchdown. <strong>Miguel Long</strong> also had an interception. Highlander coach <strong>Jordan Seiden</strong> said the team “just couldn&#8217;t sustain anything in offense until late in the game.” The Highlanders, who are playing all road games as their field gets renovated, travel to Miramonte next Friday. <em>&#8212; Joseph Dycus</em></p>
<h3>South Bay/Peninsula</h3>
<h3>Aragon 41, Homestead 13</h3>
<p><strong>Sean Hickey</strong> threw four touchdown passes to lead Aragon. Three of the scoring passes went to <strong>Jalen Scroggins</strong>, including a 99-yarder. <strong>Amaziah Tanielu</strong> and <strong>Spencer Unga</strong> added rushing touchdowns for the Dons. Aragon led 20-13 at halftime before pulling away. &#8220;They gave us problems in the first half,&#8221; Aragon coach Steve Sell said. &#8220;I was pleased we were able to clean it up in the second half.&#8221; Aragon hosts Monterey and Homestead hosts Silver Creek next Friday. <em>&#8212; Glenn Reeves</em></p>
