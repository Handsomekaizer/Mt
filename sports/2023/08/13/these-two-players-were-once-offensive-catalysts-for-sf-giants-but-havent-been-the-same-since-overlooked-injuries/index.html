    <p>SAN FRANCISCO — It&#8217;s that time of year, Alex Cobb said Saturday night, after he took the loss in the Giants&#8217; sixth defeat in their past seven games.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s August,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Everybody&#8217;s trying to catch that second wind and sprint to the finish line.&#8221;</p>
<p>As their offensive slump approaches two months, and their grip on postseason position loosens, the Giants are looking for that second wind more than most.</p>
<p>They are still feeling the effects of a two-week stretch in the middle of June.</p>
<p>As they reeled off win after win during their hottest stretch of the season — a 10-game streak that ran their record 42-32 — more players than just Mitch Haniger suffered injuries that helped lead to the current derailment of their offense.</p>
<p>Haniger has just this week resumed hitting after fracturing his forearm on a hit-by-pitch in St. Louis on June 13. The two-week stretch also saw the losses of John Brebbia, who progressed to throwing bullpens this week, Luke Jackson and Wilmer Flores to the injured list.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t overlook the players who avoided the IL.</p>
<p>J.D. Davis suffered a Grade 1 sprain in his ankle that he said Sunday lingered for a month after his unfortunate slide into third base in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Just a few days later, LaMonte Wade Jr.&#8217;s side/back tightness flared up for the first time, an issue that has since kept him unavailable off the bench in multiple games.</p>
<p>Wade, who continues to receive daily treatment on his midsection and frequently has is wrapped in athletic tape, said he wasn&#8217;t looking to make excuses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just think it&#8217;s a long season,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The way the offense is going, I don&#8217;t think anybody is going to make any excuses and say it&#8217;s because of health. But health always does play a part in things. I think we&#8217;re just one good offensive game away from getting our momentum and keeping it going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis said that while the ankle affected his base running, his struggles at the plate had to do with multiple factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;On a scale of 1-10, it was probably like a 5-6 for about two weeks and then it came down a 1-2, where it wasn&#8217;t bothering me that much, just certain movements,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It has to do with more, (expletive), I don&#8217;t even know what to tell you. It had to do with running into tough pitching. A little bit of bad luck. A little bit of trying too much because of that luck. And on top of that, just going about it with the fatigue and the travel, not that it&#8217;s any excuses or anything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the numbers are glaring.</p>
<p>The corner infield duo was playing so well that they were each gained mentions as potential first-time All-Stars, their surprise seasons carrying the Giants&#8217; offense through the first two months of the season as much as anyone else.</p>
<p>Davis was batting .286 with a .846 OPS when he injured his ankle on June 13. Wade was at .280 with an .870 OPS — powered by a .415 on-base percentage that ranked among the best in the majors — when he was scratched with side tightness on June 20.</p>
<p>They were averaging a home run every 23.7 at-bats pre-injury versus one every 31.9 after.</p>
<p>In 44 games since, Davis is batting .188 with a .571 OPS; in 33 games for Wade, he is batting .238 with a .671 OPS with a more pedestrian .345 OBP.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think any time a player is feeling a little banged up, it&#8217;s going to compromise how good they can be on the field,&#8221; manager Gabe Kapler said. &#8220;If you go back to last year and years prior with Brandon Belt, if Brandon wasn&#8217;t feeling great, he wasn&#8217;t the best version of himself. You could probably say that for (Brandon Crawford) over the last couple years, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wade, in particular, knows how compromising health problems can be. He never felt right last season after injuring his knee in spring training.</p>
<p>While the back/side tightness is an ongoing issue, he said it hasn&#8217;t affected him to the same degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s night and day different,&#8221; Wade said. &#8220;The other stuff is just lingering stuff, wear and tear from the season. I&#8217;m not too concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Kapler was quick to note, all 30 teams feel the toll of a 162-game season.</p>
<p>But not all must manage it while staring down an upcoming schedule that features the Tampa Bay Rays (71-48), Philadelphia Phillies (65-53) and Atlanta Braves (75-41) — twice.</p>
<p>Their recent skid has put their postseason standing in more precarious position, trailing the Phillies by 3½ games and holding no more than a 1½-game lead over the Cubs, Marlins and Reds in the wild card race.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we have this group out there for the rest of the season, we&#8217;re going to score a lot of runs,&#8221; Kapler said. &#8220;Michael Conforto&#8217;s going to go throuhg his good stretch; Joc Pederson&#8217;s going to go through his; (Mike Yastrzemski) will go through his; (Austin Slater) will come back around against left-handed pitching.</p>
<p>&#8220;All that stuff is going to happen if we can figure out a way to stay healthy and on the field. That&#8217;s the best way for us to succeed over the final six, seven weeks of the season.&#8221;</p>
