    <p>OAKLAND &#8212; The Oakland A&#8217;s had 12 hits Friday night but still could not keep up with the Baltimore Orioles.</p>
<p>The A&#8217;s allowed five runs in the first two innings and never fully recovered in a 9-4 loss to the Orioles before an announced crowd of 8,942 at the Coliseum.</p>
<p>Pitchers Francisco Perez, Luis Medina, and Kyle Muller combined to allow eight earned runs in the first 7 1/3 innings as the A&#8217;s gave up 16 hits and lost for the sixth time in their last seven games.</p>
<p>Medina entered the game in the second inning with the A&#8217;s down 3-1 but his velocity started to tail off for the start of the third inning, as A&#8217;s manager Mark Kotsay said he started to develop a blister.</p>
<p>For the Orioles, Gunnar Henderson hit a two-run homer in the second and added an RBI single to back Kyle Gibson&#8217;s winning start.</p>

<p>Gibson (12-7) struck out six and didn&#8217;t walk a batter, allowing four runs on nine hits over five innings coming off his first loss in seven starts. He&#8217;s one win from matching his career high done twice previously and last in 2019 with Minnesota.</p>
<p>Cedric Mullins hit a two-run double in the Orioles&#8217; three-run first that also featured an RBI single by Ryan Mountcastle. Adam Frazier contributed an RBI double, while Jordan Westburg had a run-scoring single and sacrifice fly in Baltimore&#8217;s balanced offensive attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;That lineup is a good lineup,&#8221; Kotsay said. &#8220;If we make mistakes, they&#8217;re going to capitalize.&#8221;</p>
<p>The A&#8217;s got one back in the bottom half of the first on Seth Brown&#8217;s RBI double and he hit an RBI single in the fifth. Tony Kemp and Brent Rooker added run-scoring doubles.</p>
<p>Oakland changed its pitching plan Thursday to go with opener Francisco Pérez (0-1), the 15th time the A&#8217;s used an opener and they fell to 0-5.</p>
<p>Orioles manager Brandon Hyde so appreciated Kotsay’s text Thursday that the A’s were changing starters.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of an unwritten professionalism type of thing to let the other team know as much in advance as you can give them. &#8230; And you want to reciprocate, too,&#8221; Hyde said. “I’ve seen it every different type of way. But I know Mark really well. So I would have done the same thing for him.”</p>
<p>Oakland lost for the eighth time in 10 games and the A&#8217;s have dropped the season series with the Orioles — 1-5 with two more matchups this weekend — for the first time since going 3-4 against Baltimore in 2017.</p>
<p>A&#8217;s center fielder Lawrence Butler singled twice in his home debut at the Coliseum after making his major league debut a week earlier. He now has a six-game hitting streak. Rooker had three hits and Brown and Kemp each had two in the opener of a six-game homestand.</p>
<p>Oakland lost for the eighth time in 10 games and the A&#8217;s have dropped the season series with the Orioles — 1-5 with two more matchups this weekend — for the first time since going 3-4 against Baltimore in 2017.</p>
<h3>REUNION TIME</h3>
<p>A couple of former A&#8217;s, pitchers Cole Irvin and Shintaro Fujinami, were back at the Coliseum and spent some time pregame catching up with old friends. Irvin spent the 2021 and &#8217;22 seasons with Oakland, while Fujinami was traded to the Orioles last month ahead of the deadline.</p>
<h3>TRAINER’S ROOM</h3>
<p><strong>Orioles:</strong> OF Aaron Hicks tested his back injury with some swings in the indoor cage and manager Brandon Hyde hadn&#8217;t ruled out his return Saturday. Hicks missed his third straight start since experiencing back discomfort Monday night in his first game back from a stint on the injured list.</p>

<p><strong>Athletics:</strong> 1B Ryan Noda, recovering from a fractured jaw, was playing again for Triple-A Las Vegas in his third rehab game — this time nine innings at first base and Kotsay is encouraged by his progress.</p>
<h3>UP NEXT</h3>
<p>LHP Irvin (1-3, 4.92 ERA) faces his former club Saturday night seeking his first decision since June 16 and first win since June 10. Fellow southpaw Ken Waldichuk (2-7, 6.07), who left with the lead in each of his past two outings only for the bullpen to blow the save.</p>
