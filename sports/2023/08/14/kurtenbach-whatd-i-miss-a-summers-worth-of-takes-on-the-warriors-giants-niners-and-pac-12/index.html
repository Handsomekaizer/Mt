    <p>What&#8217;d I miss?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the last two months on paternity leave, being bossed around by a nine-month-old, and working on the schedule of a little girl as headstrong and opinionated as her dad.</p>
<p>It was the most rewarding summer of my life.</p>
<p>And while I tried to keep up with the day&#8217;s news, between cleaning bottles, car naps, freeze-dried strawberries, walks, the Ferber method, and Daddy Disco Breakfasts, some things fell through the cracks.</p>
<p>OK, most things fell through the cracks.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s catch up together.</p>

<p>I wrote about this when it happened from an airport hotel next to Heathrow, and it took a few days to deduce that it was not, in fact, a jet-lagged induced fever dream.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest about what this move was: a salary dump.</p>
<p>They were wrong, I was wrong — we were all wrong about Jordan Poole. I forgive us, though, because we were drunk off one ascendant season and an improbable title. Sobriety arrived last season with a punch to the face and a hangover lasting eight months.</p>
<p>Poole will thrive, statistically, in Washington.</p>
<p>But Paul might be a better option for the Warriors this upcoming season.</p>
<p>After this season, though, the Warriors can bid Paul adieu, letting him walk in free agency and clearing his money from the books.</p>
<p>They couldn&#8217;t reasonably do that with Poole, who is signed through the 2026-27 season. That&#8217;s really why this move was made.</p>
<p>In fact, Poole&#8217;s contract was so hard to move, the Warriors attached a first-round draft pick, a second-round pick, and their two rookies from last season. (I thought Patrick Baldwin Jr. had a chance to be a nice depth piece.)</p>
<p>I heard Paul isn&#8217;t keen on coming off the bench for the first time in his career. This should be a fun storyline at the start of training camp. I can&#8217;t wait to hear Bob Myers break it down on ESPN.</p>


<p>I heard the Giants were looking young and exciting while I was away, that they were playing entertaining, winning ball.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t find any evidence of that in the standings.</p>
<p>On June 22, the day Paul was traded to the Warriors, the Giants were 3.5 games back of the NL West lead with a .558 winning percentage. Today, they&#8217;re 8.5 back with a .534 winning percentage.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the offense? The Giants have the worst OPS in baseball (.620) since the All-Star Game.</p>
<p>The bullpen has been working double shifts my whole time away, as Gabe Kapler tries to set a new major league record for relief innings pitched in a season.</p>
<p>Thank goodness the team picked up AJ Pollock — and no one else — at the trade deadline. (He went 0-for-6 in his first five games with the Giants, then went on the injured list.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some good news: Patrick Bailey – AKA Pickoff Pat or Patty Barrells — seems to be the truth, and Heliot Ramos has juice.</p>
<p>Add Marco Luciano, and the Giants have their spine for the next seven or eight years.</p>
<p>And while this year will likely still feature a few playoff games in October — this team has some grit — a deep postseason run looks out of the picture unless something dramatically changes.</p>

<p>I love being at NFL training camps. Whether that was driving up to Napa when the Raiders were still an Oakland team or cooking in the Santa Clara sun, I wanted to be there every day.</p>
<p>I thought that training camp set the baseline for the season — what you saw on those practice fields would be critical information if you wanted to truly understand the team.</p>
<p>But after missing the important parts of Niners training camp this season, I don&#8217;t feel I have missed much. All that &#8220;baseline&#8221; stuff might have just been thought anchoring.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I do know:</p>
<p>Brock Purdy&#8217;s elbow is fine, and he&#8217;s the No. 1 quarterback. That said, I&#8217;ve heard he has been unimpressive in camp. Kyle Shanahan remains undaunted, though. To him, Purdy is a cheap Kirk Cousins. This is Shanahan&#8217;s dream.</p>
<p>Niners fans&#8217; dream is winning the Super Bowl. We&#8217;ll see if the two can converge this winter. If they don&#8217;t, the Niners might end up with expensive Kirk Cousins.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the No. 2 quarterback will be Trey Lance or Sam Darnold. Preseason games will be more informative than practices in that battle, and Sunday&#8217;s preseason performance by Lance felt deeply informative.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what else I have heard and am interested in confirming first-hand in the coming days and weeks:</p>
<p>• Third-round tight end Cameron Latu is on the roster fringe, as he struggles to line up correctly or catch passes. Maybe he&#8217;s a gamer. Maybe he&#8217;ll be part of the Niners&#8217; brutal run of third-round picks since Fred Warner was selected in 2018. (Jalen Hurd in 2019; Trey Sermon and Ambry Thomas in 2021; Ty Davis-Price and Danny Gray last season.)</p>
<p>• Presumptive starting right tackle Colton McKivitz has struggled. That&#8217;s less than ideal.</p>
<p>• Brandon Aiyuk has been incredible in camp and is poised for that anticipated move to becoming a top-flight No. 1 receiver in this league.</p>
