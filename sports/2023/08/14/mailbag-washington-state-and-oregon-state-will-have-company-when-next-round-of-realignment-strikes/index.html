    <p><em>The Hotline mailbag typically publishes each Friday. Given the extraordinary developments that led to the demise of the Pac-12, we are producing three installments — the first was published Thursday, the second Saturday — in the hopes of addressing all the topics that matter to our readers.</em></p>
<p><em>Send questions to pac12hotline@bayareanewsgroup.com and include ‘mailbag’ in the subject line. Or hit me on Twitter: @WilnerHotline</em></p>
<p><em>Please note: Some questions have been edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p>
<hr />

<p>As college football roils, there are two givens: Another wave of realignment will hit the sport in the late 2020s or early 2030s; and other schools will experience fates similar to that which walloped Washington State and Oregon State.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the developments in the Pac-12 will accelerate challenges to the NCAA&#8217;s economic structure, leading to athletes being classified as employees and entitled to a share of the massive revenue.</p>
<p>Any argument that football players are mere student-athletes after the Los Angeles and Pacific Northwest schools chased the cash and joined the Big Ten seems farcical, at least from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>Attorneys for plaintiffs challenging the NCAA&#8217;s amateurism model are &#8220;salivating,&#8221; according to an industry source. &#8220;How can the schools possibly argue against the (National Labor Relations Board) &#8212; that the players aren’t employees &#8212; after all this?”</p>
<p>Any form of revenue sharing with players will increase financial pressures on athletic departments, driving a push for more money at the upper echelon of the sport &#8212; and potentially a bifurcation within the power conferences.</p>
<p>In one corner: Schools with the means and motivation to participate in a mini-NFL.</p>
<p>In the other: Schools without the wherewithal and willpower.</p>
<p>We aren&#8217;t fully convinced the powerhouses in the Big Ten and SEC will expunge the second-tier football programs from their leagues when the next media contract cycle arrives. Certainly, there would be massive political pushback.</p>
<p>But when the Big Ten signs a multi-billion-dollar deal in 2029, will Ohio State and Michigan agree to share revenue equally with Purdue and Rutgers?</p>
<p>Will Alabama and Georgia accept the same SEC distributions in the 2030s as Mississippi State and Vanderbilt?</p>
<p>Perhaps those leagues will adopt performance-based financial models, in which revenue distributions from the College Football Playoff and NCAA Tournament are based on participation and success.</p>
<p>More likely, the blue bloods will leverage a larger percentage of their conference&#8217;s guaranteed cash (the regular-season broadcast revenue), thus creating a caste system in the boardroom.</p>
<p>After all, the media companies are only going to spend so much for the rights to broadcast second-rate games.</p>
<p>At that point, there will be more have-nots than haves in major college football.</p>
<hr />

<p>We couldn&#8217;t agree more, but they won&#8217;t need to &#8220;pony up&#8221; the $34 million exit fee to join the Pac-12 next season.</p>
<p>If the &#8216;Pac-4&#8217; attempts to rebuild, it could attempt to add teams from the American Athletic Conference, which has a lower exit fee, in time for the 2024 season.</p>
<p>The second step would be adding teams from the Mountain West for the fall of 2025, when their buyout would drop to $17 million.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Pac-12&#8217;s remaining quartet might have a stockpile of cash to wield in reconstruction, potentially offsetting exit fees owed by new members to former leagues.</p>
<p>The details are unclear, with Pac-12 attorneys examining the bylaws and financial officers scouring the books to determine assets and liabilities.</p>
<hr />

<p>Yes, and there is precedent.</p>
<p>When the Big East broke apart a decade ago, the basketball-playing schools &#8212; the so-called Catholic 7 &#8212; purchased the Big East name for their new league.</p>
<p>The terms were not disclosed, but the logic was clear: The Big East name carried enormous brand value within the college basketball space, just as the Pac-12&#8217;s name has value in college athletics &#8212; far more value than the Mountain West brand.</p>
<p>But we don&#8217;t foresee that outcome.</p>
<p>If Stanford and Cal stick around, the reformed Pac-12, which could include a handful of Mountain West schools, likely would keep the name.</p>
<p>If Stanford and Cal find other homes, then the Pac-12 would dissolve with WSU and OSU joining the Mountain West.</p>
<p>There would be little motivation or logic behind purchasing the Pac-12 name when 12 of the 14 schools never competed under that banner.</p>
<hr />

<p>I&#8217;m not sure those schools make sense financially or competitively, and they are terrible fits logistically.</p>
<p>But your point about placing Olympic sports in the West Coast Conference makes loads of sense, especially for Stanford and Cal &#8230; <em>if</em> they choose to compete as Independents in football.</p>
<p>In many ways, the WCC is a better home than the Mountain West.</p>
<hr />

<p>The Pac-12 Network&#8217;s value lies in its distribution contracts, which expire next summer and won&#8217;t be renewed (for obvious reasons).</p>
<p>At that point, the only value in Larry Scott&#8217;s brainchild will be the infrastructure.</p>
<p>Without a network of its own, the Mountain West would have no use for the equipment and technology.</p>
<p>There is only one scenario in which the networks have a shred of value after the 2023-24 sports season: If the &#8216;Pac-4&#8217; schools rebuild the conference and sign a media rights deal with a streaming service that needs the Pac-12 Networks to handle event production.</p>
<hr />

<p>Were the schools seeking a baseline number of linear games per week, or appearances per season? We don&#8217;t know the specifics and perhaps never will.</p>
<p>Nor have we confirmed that the deal fully precluded Apple and the Pac-12 from selling a package of games to linear networks.</p>
<p>Clearly, no linear guarantee existed. But several key aspects of the deal were still under discussion &#8212; including the means by which the Pac-12 could hit the subscription targets &#8212; when the situation blew apart.</p>
<hr />

<p>I see what you did there.</p>

<p>And yes, the fate of the Olympic sports is top-of-mind for Stanford and Cal. The schools must weigh the logistical obstacles that would come with membership in the ACC against the competitive experience that would exist in a depleted Pac-12 or in the WCC.</p>
<p>Which is why the Big Ten makes the most sense, by far, for the Olympic sports.</p>
<p>With six schools on the West Coast, the Big Ten could craft a schedule that leans into intra-regional matchups and limits the cross-country trips for each sport.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s best for the athletes is a secondary consideration. What works for Fox and ESPN is all that matters these days.</p>
<hr />

<p>They should, but they won&#8217;t.</p>
<hr />

<p>We will continue covering the schools and the issues that matter to them, regardless of conference affiliation or the banner under which the Hotline operates. (FYI: www.WilnerHotline.com is always an option.)</p>
<p>Remember, the Hotline existed for a decade before we added Pac-12 to the name.</p>
<p>In fact, perhaps our most important work &#8212; calling attention to the flaws in Larry Scott&#8217;s business model and the growing revenue gap that would lead to the collapse of the conference &#8212; was performed long before we added &#8216;Pac-12&#8217; to the banner.</p>
<p>As always, thanks for your loyalty and support.</p>
