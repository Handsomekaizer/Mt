    <p>SANTA CLARA &#8212; Trey Lance&#8217;s twisted tenure with the 49ers reached a watershed moment Wednesday, one that was somewhat anticipated yet stunning nonetheless.</p>
<p>Beaten out by Sam Darnold for the No. 2 job behind starting quarterback Brock Purdy, Lance did not attend Wednesday&#8217;s practice as the 49ers explore options such as trading him, a league source said.</p>
<p>The 49ers did not make coach Kyle Shanahan or general manager John Lynch available for comment, other than for Shanahan to appear in a taped interview on KNBR 680-AM, the 49ers&#8217; flagship radio station.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t a thing where we&#8217;re giving up on Trey,&#8221; Shanahan told KNBR. &#8220;This is more of how Brock played in his seven games, and that was decided before the season started. And then how good Sam’s looked. They both looked good, but we do have to make a decision here and you only get so many reps at it and we feel, starting about 10 days ago, (that) Sam really separated himself and we’ve got to keep it real in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten days earlier was the 49ers&#8217; preseason opener in which Lance struggled against the Las Vegas Raiders. While Darnold improved, Shanahan said Lance at least made it &#8220;real tight, real tough,&#8221; but the QB2 decision was shared Wednesday morning, regardless of how Friday night&#8217;s preseason finale might go against the Los Angeles Chargers.</p>
<p>Shanahan&#8217;s script for that game, beyond playing the regular-season starters 10 to 20 plays: &#8220;I plan on Trey going in right after Sam.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether Lance goes along with that plan will be fascinating, after he was excused from Wednesday&#8217;s practice after Shanahan saw how &#8220;tough&#8221; he took Wednesday morning&#8217;s news.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 49ers had another quarterback in limbo while awaiting a potential trade that never came, and that quarterback was Jimmy Garoppolo, who practiced on a side field during training camp, restructured his contract, then relieved an injured Lance in the home opener and rallied the 49ers into playoff contention before Garoppolo&#8217;s foot fracture bequeathed the quarterback throne to Purdy.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Only two seasons after drafting Lance No. 3 overall via a hefty trade package, Shanahan and Lynch stood side by side as practice began and watched Purdy, Darnold and potential third-string veteran Brandon Allen warm up with throws to running backs.</p>
<p>Why wasn&#8217;t Lance there?</p>
<p>&#8220;Watching how Trey was when we talked, we just thought it was better to, ‘Hey, take the day off, get away a little bit, clear your head some, and we’ll get you back in here tomorrow,&#8217; &#8221; said Shanahan, noting how it was the 49ers&#8217; shortest practice of camp and without the intensity of pads.</p>
<p>A day earlier, Shanahan said he might rotate the backup role each game behind Purdy, who has made a remarkable recovery from March elbow surgery to retain the starting role he flourished in last season. Publicly, Shanahan said he prefer Lance stays put.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really hope, when it’s said and done, that all three of these guys are here,&#8221; Shanahan said on KNBR. &#8220;You never know when that’s gonna come up. We needed four guys last year. Doesn’t happen much, but if we can have Trey as an option here, I would feel extremely happy about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than have Shanahan or Lynch answer questions from reporters after practice, the 49ers offered up two defensive players, Javon Hargrave and Fred Warner, to answer for their bosses&#8217; quarterback move. Neither player was comfortable answering those questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly I don’t know much about the situation. Complete honesty,&#8221; linebacker Fred Warner said. &#8220;I came out to practice, I saw there were only three quarterbacks, and Trey’s not out there. So, I mean, I’m trying to ask around what’s going on. There’s not a clear answer, right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>News of Darnold securing the No. 2 job was first reported by NFL Network, about an hour before practice. Friday marks the 49ers&#8217; final preseason game, a 7 p.m. kickoff against the Los Angeles Chargers at Levi&#8217;s Stadium.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Then there were 3 (and no Trey) at 49ers QB warmups:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Darnold has 56 career starts over five seasons with the Jets and Panthers, with 61 touchdowns and 55 interceptions. Since signing with the 49ers in March, he has impressed during training camp and preseason with steady play while learning Shanahan&#8217;s offense.</p>
<p>Warner said it was &#8220;weird&#8221; seeing just three quarterbacks on the field, without Lance among them. &#8220;Obviously I love Trey,&#8221; Warner said. &#8220;I don’t know what’s going on with him right now, or what’s going to be next. But, yeah, we just have to keep preparing, get ready for a game on Friday and prepare for Pittsburgh (in the season opener).&#8221;</p>
<p>As for Darnold, Warner described his arm talent is &#8220;insane&#8221; and &#8220;there&#8217;s a reason he was drafted as high as was drafted in 18.&#8221; Darnold was the No. 3 overall draft pick in 2018, just as Lance was in 2021.</p>

<p>Allen has served as the No. 4 quarterback throughout camp, and Wednesday brought his first 11-on-11 snaps since the Aug. 13 preseason opener. Because he is an eighth-year veteran, Allen would not be subjected to waivers and can re-sign with the 49ers at his choosing if he does not make Tuesday&#8217;s initial 53-man roster.</p>
<p>In recent days, two quarterback jobs were cleared up around the league, with the Washington Commanders and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers naming Sam Howell and Baker Mayfield as their season-opening starters. The Cincinnati Bengals are navigating their way through the preseason without Joe Burrow (calf). No other starting job appears vacant, so if Lance is acquired elsewhere, it presumably would be as a backup. Shanahan said the 49ers will &#8220;always try to do right by Trey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there’s a better situation that his heart’s in and something like that, we’re going to make sure not to do something that hurts him in that way,&#8221; Shanahan said on KNBR. &#8220;That’s stuff that I talked to him about this morning, that stuff I’ll talk to him about tonight and continue to talk to him about. But Trey knows how I feel about him and and I hope he ends up being able to be here and that’s the best thing for him. But we&#8217;ve got to see what is the best thing from now until then.”</p>
<p>Lance conceivably could reunite with former 49ers coordinators who are now the head coaches with the Miami Dolphins (Mike McDaniel) and the Houston Texans (DeMeco Ryans), if they&#8217;re seeking an upgrade to back up their projected starters in Tua Tagovailoa and C.J. Stroud, respectively.</p>
<p>Lance, 23, served as the 49ers season-opening starter last year before sustaining a fractured ankle in the home opener, thrusting Jimmy Garoppolo and eventually Purdy into that job. Lance delivered a fourth-quarter comeback win in Saturday night&#8217;s 21-20 preseason victory over the Denver Broncos, but he struggled before that fantastic finish, not just in that game but in the preseason opener at Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Lance did not miss a practice throughout the offseason program or training camp, at least not until Wednesday&#8217;s watershed moment of his embattled NFL career.</p>
<p>The 49ers traded three first-round picks (2021, 2022, 2023) as well as a compensatory third-rounder in 2021 to move up from No. 12 and pick Lance.</p>
<p>After attempting just 318 passes at North Dakota State, Lance has thrown just 102 in regular-season action with the 49ers, resulting in 56 completions with five touchdowns and three interceptions.</p>
<p>Injuries hindered his development more so than any coaching or personnel moves. He broke a finger in the 2021 preseason finale, then sprained a knee in losing his career-opening start at Arizona on Oct. 10, 2021, when he had 16 carries and 15 completions. Lance won a Week 16 start over the Tennessee Titans amid the 2021 49ers&#8217; playoff push. In last season&#8217;s rainy opener, Lance and the 49ers fell at Chicago, then he got hurt the next week and required two procedures to repair an ankle that resulted in no further setbacks this offseason.</p>
<p>Shanahan still believes in Lance, but acknowledged the past two years have led to this decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do think he’s gonna have a lot of success in this league,&#8221; Shanahan said on KNBR. &#8220;It’s been a tough road for him because the times he has gotten an opportunity, he ended up getting hurt and missed that window. And now he’s in this position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each day, each rep by each quarterback was charted throughout camp. On Wednesday, Purdy completed his first 10 passes of practice, then a pass-interference penalty ruined a pass to Juaun Jennings for the only incompletion on Purdy&#8217;s 13 throws, the nicest of which was a 40-yard strike to George Kittle down the sideline. Darnold was 4-of-9, with a drop and also a near interception by Tre Swilling.</p>

<p>Left guard Aaron Banks exited Tuesday&#8217;s practice because of cramps, after losing 14 pounds in Monday&#8217;s humid practice. &#8220;It&#8217;s really hard to replenish all that weight and not, the next day, cramp up in practice,&#8221; offensive coordinator Chris Foerster said.</p>
<p>Banks, who blossomed last year as a first-year starter, is seen by Foerster as performing better in games than practice, which is unusual for linemen. &#8220;He&#8217;s in great shape. His weight&#8217;s been consistent,&#8221; Foerster said. &#8220;Sometimes in practice he gets worn down and is not as clean, but in games, he&#8217;s always fresh and ready to go. I&#8217;m really happy with his performance this camp and preseason.&#8221;</p>

<p>When it comes to the 49ers&#8217; offensive tackle spots, &#8220;great&#8221; competition exists as to who will back up All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams and right tackle Colton McKivitz, Mike McGlinchey&#8217;s replacement. The swing-tackle race is between Jaylon Moore, Matt Pryor and Leroy Watson IV.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago, Moore sustained a bruised knee and that&#8217;s lingered to hinder him. Pryor has made strides in recent weeks in practice and with the conditioning of his 6-foot-7, 332-pound frame. Watson played tight end at the University of Texas-San Antonio,</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t count Leroy Watson out,&#8221; Foerster said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a young, developing player and has not played a lot of offensive line. He&#8217;s got a steeper learning curve. He has really good talent and ability, but he&#8217;s a ways away.&#8221;</p>


<p>Roger Craig, the 49ers&#8217; dual-threat running back and an NFL pioneer, again got rejected by Pro Football Hall of Fame voters. He was among 12 senior candidates discussed Tuesday. The three maximum finalists for 2024: Linebacker Randy Gradishar Defensive tackle Steve McMichael Wide receiver Art Powell.</p>
<p>Craig is a three-time Super Bowl winner from his 49ers tenure (1983-90) who made four Pro Bowls and, in 1985, became the first player to produce 1,000 yards both rushing and receiving in a season, a feat matched since then by only Marshall Faulk (1999) and Christian McCaffrey (2019). Craig was a Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist in 2010 and 2020 before entering the seniors-candidate pool.</p>
<p>Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, and Steve Young are the only 49ers&#8217; offensive players from any of their five Super Bowl-winning teams to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The next Niner to make The Hall next year might be linebacker Patrick Willis, a two-time finalist who&#8217;ll be in his fifth year of eligibility. Semifinalists figure to be named in three months.</p>
<p>NOT PRACTICING: Among those not practicing in the 87-degree heat were wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk; running backs Christian McCaffrey and Elijah Mitchell; cornerback Ambry Thomas; defensive tackle Javon Hargrave; kicker Jake Moody; linebacker Oren Burks (knee); and, safeties Talanoa Hufanga, Tashaun Gipson and George Odum.</p>
