Canada outscored France 25-8 in the third quarter, turning what was a three-point game at the half into a runaway.</p>


<p>“I’m not surprised," Gilgeous-Alexander said. "We played really good basketball today. We did the right things on both ends of the court. ... When we play to our identity and the things we’ve been preaching for the last month...we can beat and play with anyone in the world. We just have to continue to get better and the sky’s the limit.”</p>
