    <p>SANTA CLARA &#8212; Brock Purdy smiled as he strolled the sideline, chatted up happy teammates, and savored the 49ers&#8217; opening scoring drive. It couldn&#8217;t have been a starker contrast to the last time he played in a game.</p>
<p>You know that game &#8212; in Philadelphia, with the NFC Championship on the line, and Purdy helplessly withering in pain because of a torn elbow ligament from the first series of an eventual 31-7 defeat on Jan. 29.</p>
<p>This game, it was only a preseason affair, but it reintroduced Purdy to &#8220;game speed,&#8221; and it offered the 49ers&#8217; home crowd a welcome reminder of his rookie heroics from last season, when he went from &#8220;Mr. Irrelevant&#8221; to an unbeatable wonder.</p>
<p>The 49ers rotated through three healthy quarterbacks this time around, and following Purdy and Sam Darnold came Trey Lance, who produced a game-winning drive that was capped by Jake Moody&#8217;s 32-yard field goal as time expired for a 21-20 triumph over the Denver Broncos at Levi&#8217;s Stadium.</p>
<p>One series was enough for Purdy&#8217;s re-entry, once he shook off the &#8220;normal&#8221; pregame nerves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good to be able to drive, take some hits, get right up and run a play right after that. It’s part of the game,&#8221; Purdy said after the 21-20 win over the Denver Broncos. &#8220;Honestly it helps me sort of settle into a game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sam Darnold relieved Purdy after that 10-play opening drive, which ended with a 20-yard field goal from Moody but, more important, saw Purdy escape unscathed after replicating his 2022 play-making ability.</p>
<p>Coach Kyle Shanahan said Purdy and the other Week 1 starters will make encores Friday, in the preseason finale against the Los Angeles Chargers at Levi&#8217;s Stadium.</p>
<p>Purdy says his arm is &#8220;feeling really good, honestly,&#8221; adding that he simply needs to hone in on details and be consistent in practice, &#8220;so, come Week 1, be ready to rip it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After bombing in last Sunday&#8217;s preseason opener at Las Vegas, Lance rallied the 49ers down the stretch with a pair of scoring drives in the final 2 1/2 minutes,</p>
<p>&#8220;We all want to see him succeed and do great,&#8221; Purdy said. &#8220;To go out there and chip away and put together two great drives at the end, it was awesome to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, a Purdy-to-Darnold order like Saturday&#8217;s could reflect the 49ers&#8217; depth chart for their Sept. 10 season opener. Darnold failed to points on his three drives that left the 49ers with a 6-3 halftime deficit, but he stayed in after halftime and capped a go-ahead touchdown drive with an 11-yard scoring strike to undrafted rookie fullback Jack Colletto.</p>
<p>Protecting Purdy were 4-of-5 offensive linemen expected to start in the Sept. 10 season opener at Pittsburgh, the lone exception being All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams, who was safely stashed on the sideline with running back Christian McCaffrey and tight end George Kittle. Jalen Moore started in place of Williams.</p>
<p>Purdy made more than a ceremonial appearance. He completed 4-of-5 passes while targeting the 49ers&#8217; top three wide receivers: Deebo Samuel (25 yards, 14 yards), Jauan Jennings (21 yards) and Brandon Aiyuk (11 yards).</p>
<p>Those weren&#8217;t the hold-your-breath plays, however. Rather, Purdy endured his first sack, and, voila, escaped injury. Running back Ty Davis-Price whiffed on a block, and Purdy avoided one defender before being gently dragged down by Jonathon Cooper at the 10-yard line, for an 8-yard loss. The next play was even more teeth-gritting: Purdy scrambled, opted not to throw to an open Jennings at the goal line, and raced to the 3-yard line, setting up the first successful field goal by Moody.</p>
<p>Seven months ago, on the 49ers&#8217; home field, Purdy produced his eighth win in eight games since replacing an injured Jimmy Garoppolo. After that 19-12 divisional playoff triumph over the Dallas Cowboys, next came a fateful showdown at Philadelphia for the NFC title. Purdy&#8217;s right-elbow ligament got torn on a sack, and it got repaired March 10 via an internal-brace procedure that allowed for an expedited comeback, rather than a year-long hiatus with Tommy John reconstructive surgery.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Purdy was cleared to practice at the start of training camp 3 1/2 weeks ago, did not experience any setback while on a pitch count, and he cleared a &#8220;huge&#8221; milestone last week by maintaining his velocity amid his first string of practicing three consecutive days.</p>
<p>Darnold didn&#8217;t push the 49ers down field as well in relief of Purdy. Third-down situations proved problematic, from an incompletion on Darnold&#8217;s first series to three Broncos sacking him on his second drive.</p>
<p>After halftime, Darnold had a third-down pass go through Ronnie Bell&#8217;s hands, deflect off his helmet and land in the Broncos&#8217; hands for an interception, reminiscent to a Bell-drop-interception last game. Darnold stayed in for the next series to produce a go-ahead touchdown, but Moody missed the point-after kick wide right.</p>
<p>Darnold finished 11-of-14 with 109 yards, a touchdown and an interception. Lance finished off his 12-of-18 passing line (173 yards, one touchdown, one interception) by finding Bell for 14- and 43-yard catch-and-runs to set up the winner by Moody.</p>
<p>Defensively, the 49ers also gave many Week 1 starters their first action this preseason. Sunday&#8217;s lineup featured Javon Hargrave&#8217;s debut on a line next to Arik Armstead, Kerry Hyder Jr. and Clelin Ferrell; linebackers Fred Warner, Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles, and Curtis Robinson; cornerbacks Charvarius Ward and Ambry Thomas; and, safeties Talanoa Hufanga and rookie Ji&#8217;Ayir Brown.</p>
<p>This preseason&#8217;s first game-related injury took out Danny Gray (shoulder). Gray, an embattled second-year receiver, returned the opening kickoff 23 yards before being steered out of bounds.</p>
<p>Hyder also left with a shoulder injury, and that impacts the defensive line&#8217;s depth. Nick Bosa still hasn&#8217;t reported, though it&#8217;s believed contract-extension talks are heating up ahead of the season opener. Earlier Saturday, the 49ers placed Aug. 1 acquisition Taco Charlton on injured reserve, where they also put fellow defensive end Darryl Johnson two weeks ago.</p>
