    <p>HENDERSON, Nev. – Fred Warner called Jimmy Garoppolo “my guy.” Christian McCaffrey said he owes Garoppolo a “big hug.” Brock Purdy enjoyed seeing “good ol’ Jim.”</p>
<p>Gawking at Garoppolo in a Raiders uniform, against his former 49ers’ teammates, tapped into an emotional vein Thursday, the first of back-to-back days of joint practices before Sunday’s preseason opener in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>As genuinely grateful as everyone came across about Garoppolo&#8217;s 5 ½-year engagement with the 49ers, a sense of resentment sears in the background.</p>
<p>Garoppolo indeed can claim “I treasure those times” and that &#8220;those are my brothers, I love those guys.&#8221; Coach Kyle Shanahan can go so far as to say “he was the best quarterback here in about 20 years, since Steve Young.”</p>
<p>Big picture: the 49ers never got their sixth Lombardi Trophy, and Garoppolo did not get to keep his job, though he was handsomely rewarded with more than $121 million. A divorce was inevitable, starting with Trey Lance’s 2021 arrival as the No. 3 draft pick, and eventually ending with Brock Purdy’s storybook ascent to the QB1 throne upon replacing an injured Garoppolo for last season’s playoff push.</p>

<p>Garoppolo was the movie-star-face of the franchise, which he now is for the Raiders. Whatever bitterness lingers over his 49ers exodus, Garoppolo internalizes that with any other career criticism, for self-motivation purposes.</p>
<p>“It’s in there. Yeah, it’s in there. Everyone has different ways of dealing with stuff,” Garoppolo said. “Some people like to vocalize it. Some people like to keep it in and just let their play do the talk. That’s how I’ve always been, and I’m not changing.”</p>
<p>That style endeared him to 49ers&#8217; teammates in past seasons, and several checked in with him at Thursday&#8217;s reunion, including Purdy, Warner and, during a break in the action, general manager John Lynch. Shanahan did not mosey over to Garoppolo during the two-hour practice, the coach noting: &#8220;I would have liked to but they’re on a different field. I didn’t talk to one of their offensive guys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garoppolo played pretty well, highlighted by his final pass for a touchdown to tight end Austin Hooper, beating the coverage of Oren Burks and Talanoa Hufanga.</p>
<p>Eight months ago, Garoppolo’s final play for the 49ers saw him sacked, but only after he dragged two Miami Dolphins defenders back into field-goal range and sustained a fractured foot in the process. Rather than go on Injured Reserve, Garoppolo rehabbed in the background, without ever returning to practice but keeping alive hopes of a comeback, if the 49ers reached the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“It was wild, man. I was doing my thing, trying to get my foot ready and it didn’t work out the way I wish it would have,” Garoppolo said. “But those guys, going through three quarterbacks and still making it to the NFC Championship Game, I mean that’s damn impressive for a team.”</p>

<p>Shanahan had another quarterback on call if the 49ers reached the Super Bowl: Philip Rivers, who was in his second year of retirement after 18 years with the Chargers and one with the Colts.</p>
<p>“He was prepared to,” Shanahan said of Rivers’ potential return. “That’s stuff we talked about throughout the whole year. We would&#8217;ve had to seen how that was for the Super Bowl, but that was the plan most of the year.”</p>
<p>That was news – and a moot point &#8212; to some 49ers when relayed that information Thursday.  Said McCaffrey: &#8220;The past is the past. From here on out, I’m just focused on this year.” Added Warner: “We didn’t go to the Super Bowl, so it doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>The 49ers did reach that stage four seasons ago, in Garoppolo’s only season he started every game.</p>
<p>Shanahan took umbrage with the notion he crudely severed ties with Garoppolo, which stems from the coach saying at season’s end he could not envision Garoppolo’s return.</p>
<p>“That was overblown on trying to be a shot at him or anything,” Shanahan said. “We knew Jimmy wasn’t coming back on his standpoint and our standpoint, financially and everything. That was just the common-sense answer.”</p>

<p>Then Shanahan explained why he views Garoppolo’s “legacy” as an “unbelievable” one.</p>
<p>“He was the best quarterback here in about 20 years, since Steve Young,” said Shanahan, a ballboy on the 1992-94 teams led by Young. “He has an unbelievable record, and every time he played and stayed healthy, we were either in the Super Bowl or the NFC Championship Game. So, I hope no one insinuates I’ve ever said differently.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on “my choosing” to put off foot surgery in hopes of extending his 49ers career in a Super Bowl, Garoppolo summed things up Thursday saying: “Whatever. It’s all in the past. Things worked out the way it did. I’m happy how it all worked out.”</p>
<p>Raiders coach Josh McDaniels, prior to practice, did his best to downplay the Garoppolo-49ers reunion: &#8220;I’m not going to overdramatize the moment. He’ll get a handful of reps today and so will other guys. It’s a training camp practice, with another team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garoppolo was not just another 49ers quarterback. He went 38-17 as their starter, plus a 4-2 playoff record. He, perhaps unwittingly, also groomed Purdy how to be a model pro, how to act in the locker room, how to crisply call plays in the huddle, how to read through on-field progressions, how to timely get off passes, and, &#8220;just do what coach asks and be successful in that regard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He did a lot of great things here, and in my little time that I had with him this past season, it was a lot for me to learn, and it was a blessing,&#8221; Purdy said.</p>
<p>Garoppolo, in turn, learned something about Purdy that 49ers fans also are discovering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brock is a cool dude, on and off the field,&#8221; Garoppolo said. &#8220;As a rookie, he was pretty quiet off the get-go. But he started opening up toward the end, especially when he started playing. We talked out there today a little bit. It sounded like he’s doing good.&#8221;</p>
