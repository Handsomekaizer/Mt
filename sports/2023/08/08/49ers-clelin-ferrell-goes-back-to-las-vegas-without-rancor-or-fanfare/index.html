    <p>SANTA CLARA &#8212; Freed from the weight of expectations and given carte blanche to simply read and react, 49ers defensive end Clelin Ferrell goes back to Las Vegas this week without a tinge of bitterness or regret.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think my time with the Raiders was a blessing,&#8221; Ferrell said Monday following practice. &#8220;I can live and be happy with what happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferrell, 26, was a controversial No. 4 overall pick out of Clemson by the Oakland Raiders in 2019. As the Ted Hendricks Award winner as the top defensive end in college football in 2018 and with a national championship on his resume, Ferrell was a decorated college player.</p>
<p>His selection was mostly panned, though, by draft analysts who didn&#8217;t think he was worth being selected No. 4 after Kyler Murray (Arizona), Nick Bosa (49ers) and Quinnen Williams (New York Jets).</p>
<p>Most projections had Ferrell as a first-round pick, but somewhere in the middle or late in the round.</p>
<p>Murray and Williams both have signed megadeal contract extensions and Bosa awaits the same. The Raiders actually found an elite edge rusher in the 2019 draft in fourth-round pick Maxx Crosby and signed him to a four-year contract worth a maximum of $94 million in March of 2022.</p>
<p>As for Ferrell, the Raiders declined his fifth-year option, and he signed a one-year contract with the 49ers that will pay him $2.5 million should he meet per-game roster bonuses.</p>
<p>At 6-foot-4, 265 pounds, Ferrell wasn&#8217;t a quick-twitch edge force like Bosa, and here he was, going to a franchise about to leave town with the expectation that he would be the next Khalil Mack.</p>
<p>In four years, Ferrell played under three head coaches (Jon Gruden, Rich Bisaccia, Josh McDaniels) and four defensive coordinators (Paul Guenther, Rod Marinelli, Gus Bradley, Patrick Graham).</p>
<p>Ferrell had a solid but unspectacular rookie year in which he had 4 1/2 sacks. It turned out to be his best season in silver and black. He started just four times in his last two seasons and finished his Raiders career with 12 sacks in 58 games with 30 starts.</p>

<p>The Raiders never had an issue with Ferrell&#8217;s effort or attitude, which were as advertised and exemplary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave my all to that organization and left it better,&#8221; Ferrell said.</p>
<p>When free agency beckoned, two former Raiders teammates &#8212; defensive end Arden Key and defensive tackle Maurice Hurst &#8212; lobbied on behalf of the 49ers and line coach Kris Kocurek.</p>
<p>Key turned his career around with a 6 1/2-sack season in 2021; he&#8217;d had just three sacks in three years with the Raiders. Hurst played just two games with the 49ers in 2021 before being injured and spent all last season on injured reserve, but spoke highly of the organization.</p>
<p>Key played with Jacksonville last season and is now with Tennessee. Hurst is with the Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those guys gave me some reassurance about just trusting in what we do here as a team,&#8221; Ferrell said. &#8220;It gave me some inside information, but every team is different and I&#8217;m a new fish out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Key-Hurst bottom line?</p>
<p>&#8220;If you really respect this game and do what they say and do it to the best of your abilities, everything will pan out,&#8221; Ferrell said.</p>
<p>Ferrell likes Kocurek&#8217;s &#8220;turn &#8217;em loose&#8221; mindset and believes it will make him better.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Coach Kris has been really, really big for me, just from the aspect of taking a lot of the thinking and reading out of my game,&#8221; Ferrell said. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m just reacting. I feel like we&#8217;re a pack of animals out there and playing off instinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kocurek got a recommendation from Marinelli, who served as both defensive line coach and was an interim defensive coordinator in 2020, and is eager to see Ferrell turned loose.</p>
<p>&#8220;His first couple of years he was allowed to play fast,&#8221; Kocurek said. &#8220;The last couple of years he&#8217;s been in a hybrid-type defense where they were asking him to do a lot of different things like dropping, spying. He&#8217;s a really long player (who) I think can match up on the edge in the run game for us. He can get under blockers and set really good edges. And the thing you always hear about Cle, going back to his days at Clemson, is he&#8217;s a worker.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferrell is competing with second-year player Drake Jackson to start opposite Bosa when he arrives. But both could get plenty of snaps, and Ferrell also has the versatility to play occasionally inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tight,&#8221; 49ers defensive coordinator Steve Wilks said. &#8220;When we go to Vegas and play the Raiders, we&#8217;ll see exactly where we&#8217;re at at that point and hopefully guys can separate themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides giving tips to teammates and coaches about dealing with the heat and dry air of Las Vegas &#8212; &#8220;bring chapstick and put Vaseline in your nose&#8221; &#8212; Ferrell is looking forward to seeing his former teammates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The league is a brotherhood and I have a lot of really good relationships back there,&#8221; Ferrell said. &#8220;A lot of guys on defense. Offense too. I&#8217;m excited, definitely looking forward to the competition. It&#8217;s going to be fun.&#8221;</p>
