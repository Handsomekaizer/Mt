    <p>SANTA CLARA &#8212; Here is Monday&#8217;s practice report on how the 49ers&#8217; quarterbacks looked at training camp:</p>

<p>Purdy&#8217;s comeback from elbow surgery gets its first test this week beyond facing the 49ers&#8217; defense. He&#8217;ll go against the Raiders, albeit in joint practices Thursday and Friday in Las Vegas rather than any likely cameo in Sunday&#8217;s preseason opener.</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt Brock plays (Sunday),&#8221; coach Kyle Shanahan said after Monday&#8217;s sweltering two-hour session.</p>
<p>Purdy&#8217;s work after Tuesday&#8217;s send-off practice will be to excel in joint practices, which Shanahan views with much higher regard than preseason games. After all, last year&#8217;s joint sessions in Minnesota boosted Purdy&#8217;s stock and effectively sealed a roster spot for the draft&#8217;s 262nd and final draft pick.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say Purdy&#8217;s seven practices this training camp have been easy-going; he has rested three practices as part of his arm rehabilitation schedule.</p>
<p>Clelin Ferrell, who signed with the 49ers this offseason, has been rushing Purdy in practice throughout camp, including making ill-advised contact with the QB last week. (Purdy dismissed it as football in a &#8220;competing environment.&#8221; He praised what he&#8217;s seen from the second-year quarterback so far.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to see his mental toughness is something that’s really, really good, especially for a young player,&#8221; Ferrell added. &#8220;I’ve played against Patrick Mahomes and Justin Herbert, and I would say the one thing about those guys: They never run from confrontation. He enjoys the competition aspect and that’s really, really good to see from a guy that’s really the head of a really well-developed veteran team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferrell often is coming from Purdy&#8217;s blind side as a high-energy rusher against All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams, and he must walk a fine line in when to ease his pursuit while trying to prove his worth after four seasons with the Raiders as a 2019 first-round pick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I don’t get to him or if I don’t win on a rush,&#8221; Ferrell said. &#8220;I try to touch him every play or even jab him in his stomach or touch him just on his back &#8230; to let him know I’m right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purdy completed 9-of-18 passes Monday, one of which was intercepted by Tashaun Gipson Sr. after being tipped by linebacker Dre Greenlaw. Purdy&#8217;s best throw came when he found Jauan Jennings at the front right pylon for a touchdown against Ward, who playfully jawed with Jennings earlier in practice and again after that play.</p>
<p>Purdy is expected to practice in Tuesday&#8217;s lighter session &#8212; Monday&#8217;s spanned two hours. Wednesday is a players&#8217; day off, then they face the Raiders in joint practices. A year ago, Purdy used joint practices at Minnesota and the ensuing preseason game to push past Nate Sudfeld on the depth chart, as Shanahan later revealed.</p>
<p>Linebacker Oren Burks has been impressed with Purdy since last year. Burks used to play with Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers before joining the 49ers last season.</p>
<p>&#8220;The poise is very similar, especially coming from a young guy,&#8221; Burks said, comparing Purdy to Rodgers. &#8220;It’s very rare to see a guy come into a situation like he did last year and handle himself like a pro.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ll see how his career progress but I’m super proud of Brock, even just as a person,&#8221; Burks added. &#8220;He’s a great human being and person to be around, and people feed off that. The poise in the pocket and the way he leads the huddle, it’s different.&#8221;</p>

<p>Darnold went first in the QB2 rotation with Trey Lance, and after nearly having a pass intercepted by Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles, Darnold found Ray-Ray McCloud with a red-zone touchdown pass between defenders A.J. Parker and Ji&#8217;Ayir Brown.</p>
<p>Speaking of interceptions, Darnold has not thrown one in full-team drills all camp, which Shanahan initially disputed before reporters insisted otherwise. Darnold entered camp focused on better ball security (55 interceptions in 55 career starts), so Shanahan said &#8220;he&#8217;s done a good job&#8221; avoiding them in 49ers camp. Shanahan added he doesn&#8217;t examine practices on a statistical basis, but rather on consistency, accuracy and pass-rush awareness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half these (passes) aren’t getting off because not we&#8217;re sacking guys out there,&#8221; Shanahan said.</p>
<p>On one play, Darnold scrambled out of the pocket, rolled right and unloaded a pass after he crossed the line of scrimmage; it&#8217;s not included in his 5-of-8 passing line.</p>

<p>Lance opened his 3-of-7 practice with an interception, which Flannigan-Fowles made after Austin Bryant provided pressure past right tackle Matt Pryor. Two other misses of note: Parker broke up a pass toward Jennings in the end zone, and a deep shot toward Tay Martin got overthrown.</p>
<p>Lance ran twice among his limited snaps, including once on a red-zone draw. There has not been an emphasis on option keepers as last year&#8217;s camp with Lance.</p>


<p>His third-team snaps came in the first hour of practice, and he completed all three of his red-zone passes to running backs after an earlier incompletion to Ty Davis-Price.</p>

<p>&#8211;Shanahan is &#8220;not at all&#8221; concerned about Nick Bosa&#8217;s ongoing absence from camp as contract talks continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just stay out of it,&#8221; Shanahan said. &#8220;There’s not much to ask. &#8230; I don’t know if Bosa has ever done a (full) training camp, and he&#8217;s done pretty good. Everyone Wants people here. It doesn&#8217;t affect the team much from a defensive end standpoint. I have as much confident in Nick from any player I&#8217;ve been around in how he prepares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211;Wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk did not practice for the first time this camp in what was a well-deserved rest day.</p>
<p>Still not practicing: running back Elijah Mitchell (adductor), guard Aaron Banks (concussion), offensive tackle Jaylon Moore (knee), defensive end Robert Beal Jr. (hamstring) and defensive tackle Kalia Davis (knee).</p>
<p>&#8211;Christian McCaffrey began his impressive practice with a touchdown catch against rookie linebacker Jalen Graham in one-on-one drills. Danny Gray had two impressive touchdown catches in one-on-one work.</p>
<p>&#8211;Oren Burks remains positioned to take the strong-side linebacker role, formerly occupied by Azeez Al-Shaair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting for this opportunity for a while and it&#8217;s here, so I&#8217;m focused every day to get better, to put my best stuff on tape for coaches to evaluate,&#8221; Burks said. &#8220;We have a great offense with a lot of different looks that cause trouble for a lot of defenses, so what better time now than to compete against the best.&#8221;</p>
