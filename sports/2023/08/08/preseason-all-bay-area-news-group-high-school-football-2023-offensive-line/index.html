    <h3><strong>Preseason all-BANG high school football 2023</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Offensive linemen</strong></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">(listed in alphabetical order)</span></i></p>
<p><b>Bennett Anderson, Bellarmine,  6-5, 270, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yale commit. Had 11 offers, including every Ivy League school but Dartmouth. Several Power 5 schools showed interest, among them Cal, Stanford, UCLA, Oregon State. Will likely play OT at Yale. Excellent long-snapper. 247sports 3-star recruit.</span></p>
<p><b>Alex Bleszynski, Archbishop Mitty, 6-3, 285, junior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Listed as OG on the Monarchs’ roster. One of only six starters back from last season’s 9-4 team. Brought up midway through season. Started at center. Will play mostly on OL this season, but expected to help out on DL.</span></p>
<p><b>Julian Cambra, San Ramon Valley, 6-2, 225, junior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First-team all-EBAL in two sports during sophomore year: left tackle in football, designated hitter in baseball. Besides his LT duties, will get some playing time on the DL. As good as he is on the gridiron, baseball might be his best sport.</span></p>
<p><b>Kamani Fifita, Arroyo, 6-5, 310, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tennyson coach John Pangelina tweeted that Fifita is the most underrated OL in the Bay Area. Hasn’t been offered but drawing interest from Cal, Stanford, San Jose State and others, said 247sports. First-team OL last season in Shoreline Division of West Alameda County Conference.</span></p>
<p><b>John Holthaus, Serra, 6-7, 290, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Colorado State commit. Also offered by Portland State. Rated a 3-star recruit by 247sports. Two stars from Rivals. Has added 10 pounds since last season ended. Serra coach Patrick Walsh called Holthaus his top OL. </span></p>
<p><b>Justin Hylkema, Wilcox, 6-8, 315, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Committed to Arizona. One of Bay Area’s top OTs. Offered by Cal, Washington State, UNLV, Utah State, Nevada. Earned 3-star rankings from 247sports, Rivals, ESPN and On3. Big and physical, moves well for his size, according to one scouting report. </span></p>
<p><b>Peter Langi, Riordan, 6-5, 330, junior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Big-time recruit. Transferred from Mater Dei-Santa Ana so he could join younger brother Michael at Riordan. Has 15 Power-5 offers, including USC, Michigan, LSU, Texas A&amp;M, Utah, Washington. On3 recruiting site predicting a USC/Cal recruiting battle, but it’s early. Can play tackle or guard.</span></p>
<p><b>Berlin Lillard, Bishop O’Dowd, 6-5, 325, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Will join Serra’s John Holthaus at Colorado State. Rated a 3-star recruit at OT by 247sports. Plays nose guard on defense. Was receiving interest from Cal, Columbia, Brown. Good student. Lists computer engineering as a major interest.</span></p>
<p><b>Rayne Mayo, Valley Christian, 6-3, 300, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of two Warriors along with Champ Taulealea who ranks among Bay Area News Group’s top offensive linemen. Three-star recruit as ranked by 247sports. Has 14 offers including Air Force, Army, Navy, Columbia, Cornell, UC-Davis, Sacramento State. First-team all-WCAL OL last season. Will play OG.</span></p>
<p><b>John Mills, St. Ignatius, 6-6, 310, junior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Budding star with offers from Cal, UCLA, Washington. Received three stars from 247sports, On3 recruiting sites. Can move. Reminds some of former 49ers Pro Bowl right guard Kevin Gogan from Sacred Heart Cathedral. </span></p>
<p><b>Manuel Serna, Clayton Valley, 6-6, 290, senior </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Received 3-star ranking from 247sports. Strengths are quick feet and solid pass blocking. Has seven offers, including San Jose St., Utah St., and Nevada. UC Davis and Sacramento St. have also offered.  </span></p>
<p><b>Champ Taulealea, Valley Christian, 6-4, 330, junior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of Bay Area’s 10 best players regardless of position or class. Rated 4-star OT by 247sports, Rivals, ESPN. 247sports ranks him California’s No. 16 overall player in 2025 class. Has 10 Power-5 offers including Cal, USC, Oregon, Washington, Texas. Invited to the 2025 Polynesian Bowl.</span></p>
<p><b>Xavier Thorpe, Livermore, 6-5, 270, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Holds offers from Washington State, San Jose State, Nevada, Penn. Will play RT this season. Will see some time on D-Line as well. Super athletic and strong, says Livermore coach John Wade. Earned second-team all-EBAL Valley honors in 2022. </span></p>
<p><b>Tommy Tofi, Riordan, 6-7, 330, sophomore</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Comes to Riordan from Sheldon-Elk Grove. Has 11 Power-5 offers, including Cal, Stanford, USC, Oregon, Washington, Utah. Could be part of the most heavily recruited OL in NorCal, as he and three of his linemates already have multiple Power 5 offers.</span></p>
<p><b>Ikinasio Tupou, Palo Alto, 6-6, 290, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Believed to be a heavy Washington lean. Huskies recruiting him as OT. Also plays DE. One of the top five OL prospects in Bay Area. Was first-team all-PAL DeAnza at OL last season. Has nine Power-5 offers, including Cal.   </span></p>
<p><b>Sione Vailea, McClymonds, 6-3, 285, junior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First-team all-OAL OL. Gives Mack a strong presence up front, which it will need with a non-league slate that includes Bellarmine, San Ramon Valley and De La Salle. Vailea doesn’t have any offers but is on the radar of plenty of schools, including Oregon State.</span></p>
<p><b>Ryan Vernale, Los Gatos, 6-3, 255, senior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Offensive Lineman of the Year last season in the PAL De Anza. Was key contributor on defense with 44 tackles. No offers thus far, which is a little surprising given the success of the Los Gatos program. Height is the issue, says coach Mark Krail. Another inch or two, and schools would be knocking down his door.  </span></p>
<p><b>Siosiua Vete, Tennyson, 6-6, 280, junior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rates right behind Valley Christian’s Champ Taulealea among Bay Area’s best OL prospects. Seven Power-5 offers, including Stanford, which is considered the heavy favorite to eventually sign him. Rated a 4-star by 247sports Composite. Played last season at Fremont-Oakland. </span></p>
