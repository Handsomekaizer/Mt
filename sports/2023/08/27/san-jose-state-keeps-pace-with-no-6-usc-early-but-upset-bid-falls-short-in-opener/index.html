    <p>LOS ANGELES — Chevan Cordeiro passed for 198 yards and threw three touchdowns, but it wasn’t enough as No. 6 USC totaled 501 yards of total offense to hand San Jose State a 56-28 loss in its season opener at the L.A. Coliseum Saturday night.</p>

<p>The Spartans entered the game as 31-point underdogs, but kept the game close in the first half as they trailed 21-14 going into halftime. Reigning Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams led USC to 35 second-half points leading the Trojans to a dominant win at home.</p>
<p>“We didn&#8217;t make the plays we needed to, to stay in it and keep it close and that was disappointing,” said SJSU head coach Brent Brennan. “We have a couple of breakdowns that really hurt us. But that&#8217;s football. I think we have a resilient team.”</p>
<p>Nick Nash had a big night teaming with Cordeiro, catching six passes for 89 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
<p>“(Nick and I) have been building that connection since spring ball,” Cordeiro said. “Him being a quarterback really shows. He’s smart, he knows the coverages and he knows where he has to be to make me comfortable.”</p>
<p>Quali Conley rushed for 108 yards on just six carries in his debut with the Spartans. Conley, a junior, transferred to SJSU after rushing for 1,095 yards and eight touchdowns at Utah Tech last season.</p>
<p>The Spartans gained some momentum with eight seconds remaining in the first half after Cordeiro found Nash on the right sideline for a 28-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to just seven going into the second half. But the Trojans outscored the Spartans 21-7 in the third quarter capped off by a 96-yard kick return by USC freshman wide receiver Zachariah Branch.</p>

<p>Williams didn&#8217;t play the whole game, but was efficient. He completed 18 of 25 attempts for 278 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Antioch&#8217;s Austin Jones was the Trojans&#8217; leading rusher, gaining 54 yards on six carries. He scored two touchdowns, including a three-yard run early in the third quarter that helped USC begin to pull away for good.</p>

<p>The Trojans improved to 6-0 all-time against the Spartans and have now beaten SJSU twice in the last three seasons. SJSU will go up against another PAC-12 foe when they face Oregon State at 12:30 p.m. in a rare Sunday game at CEFCU Stadium.</p>
<p>“I think we’re going to be a little bit more prepared for Oregon State and what they have to bring for us defensively,” Nash said. “We’re excited to play them.”</p>
