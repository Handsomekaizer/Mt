<p>France came to the World Cup planning to win gold. It won't even make the second round, an absolutely stunning development for the reigning Olympic silver medalists.</p>


<p>Latvia got 22 points from Arturs Zagars and shocked France 88-86 Sunday night in a Group H game at Jakarta, Indonesia. The result sent Latvia and Canada through to the second round, and meant France — which won the bronze at the last two World Cups — cannot finish better than 17th place this year.</p>


<p>“We let a lot of people down, ourselves first,” French forward Nicolas Batum said.</p>


<div class='s2nFriendlyFrame k k-k2NaSI50' data-type='float' data-s2n-api='setupS2NApi'></div><script type='text/javascript' async src='https://embed.sendtonews.com/player4/embedcode.js?fk=k2NaSI50&cid=9365&offsety=125&floatwidth=400&floatposition=top-right' data-type='s2nScript'></script>

<p>Rolands Smits added 20 points and Davis Bertans had 15 points, as Latvia rallied from a 13-point deficit. It took the lead for the first time with 37.7 seconds left and held on when Sylvain Francisco missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer.</p>


<p>“Congrats to Latvia,” Batum said. “They earned it. They deserved it.”</p>


<p>Evan Fournier had 27 points for France, which lost to Canada in its opener.</p>


<p>The momentum swung in the middle of the fourth quarter when France playmaker Nando de Colo was ejected after receiving his second unsportsmanlike foul.</p>


<p>Latvia and Canada will play for Group H’s top spot on Tuesday.</p>

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">
GROUP H — CANADA 128, LEBANON 73
</div>

<p>At Jakarta, RJ Barrett scored 17 points as Canada overpowered Lebanon to continue its perfect start.</p>


<p>Trae Bell-Haynes added 15 points and eight assists for Canada (2-0), which opened with an impressive 95-65 win over France. Canada set a senior men’s national team record for points — it scored 126 against Jordan at the World Cup four years ago — and set a tournament record with 44 assists.</p>


<p>FIBA began keeping assist records in 1984.</p>


<p>After recording 27 points in his World Cup debut, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had 12 points, five rebounds and five assists in 17 minutes. Canada used 11 players and nine reached double figures; the others were Melvin Ejim (13), Kelly Olynyk (12), Zach Edey (12), Nickeil Alexander-Walker (12), Kyle Anderson (10) and Dillon Brooks (10).</p>


<p>Canada shot 71%, and played without Lu Dort, who was held out with soreness. Former NBA player Omari Spellman led Lebanon with 16 points.</p>


<p>Canada plays Latvia on Tuesday in its final group game, while Lebanon (0-2) faces France.</p>

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">
GROUP A — DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 87, ITALY 82
</div>

<p>At Manila, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andres Feliz each scored 24 points, and the Dominican Republic connected on 16 3-pointers to beat Italy and move to the brink of the second round.</p>


<p>Feliz had seven of those 3s for the winners (2-0). Towns finished with 11 rebounds and Jean Montero had 12 points, nine assists, six rebounds and three steals.</p>


<p>“Getting the job done,” Towns said. “I think we did a great job and found a way to win. Andres and everybody down the line was amazing. This was a great team win.”</p>


<p>A win over Angola on Tuesday would clinch a second-round trip for the Dominican Republic. The team could lose that game and still advance, based on other results.</p>


<p>Italy (1-1) led 12-0 to open the game but led only 39-38 at the half — and lost coach Gianmarco Pozzecco to a second-quarter ejection after he picked up his second technical foul.</p>


<p>The game changed entirely in the third; the Dominican Republic outscored Italy 31-17 in those 10 minutes, then held off a rally in the fourth.</p>


<p>Marco Spissu led Italy with 17 points, while Simone Fontecchio scored 13, Giampaolo Ricco had 12 and Achille Polonara added 10.</p>


<p>Italy remains alive in the race for the second round and plays the Philippines to end group play on Tuesday. It's a must-win for the Philippines to have any chance.</p>


<p>“It’s going to be exciting,” Italy’s Luigi Datome said. “It’s going to be a nice atmosphere and all the players like to play in a nice atmosphere.”</p>

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">
GROUP A — ANGOLA 80, PHILIPPINES 70
</div>

<p>At Manila, Gerson Goncalves scored 17 points, Gerson Domingos added 15 and Angola erased an 11-point deficit to beat the Philippines.</p>


<p>Bruno Fernando scored 14 for Angola (1-1), which trailed 28-17 early in the second quarter -- and then outscored the hosts 56-29 over the next 24 minutes.</p>


<p>Even with the loss, the Philippines (0-2) remains alive in the race for a second-round spot. It must beat Italy Tuesday and get some help.</p>


<p>Jordan Clarkson had 21 points for the Philippines.</p>

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">
GROUP E — GERMANY 85, AUSTRALIA 82
</div>

<p>At Okinawa, Dennis Schroder scored 30 points and added eight assists for Germany (2-0). The win, combined with Japan's win over Finland later Sunday, sent Germany to the second round.</p>


<p>Maodo Lo scored 20 for Germany, which trailed by four entering the final quarter but opened it on a 10-0 run.</p>


<p>Australia tied the game twice in the fourth. Both times, Schroder had an immediate answer to reclaim the lead. His basket with 46 seconds left put Germany ahead for good.</p>


<p>Patty Mills, as he did in the first game, led Australia with 21 points, five rebounds and six assists. Matisse Thybulle had 17 for Australia, which was only 9 for 16 from the foul line.</p>


<p>Germany played without Franz Wagner, who sat with an ankle injury.</p>


<p>Australia faces Japan — the home team in the group — on Tuesday, with the winner moving to the second round. Germany finishes group play against Finland.</p>

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">
GROUP E — JAPAN 98, FINLAND 88
</div>

<p>At Okinawa, Joshua Hawkinson scored 28 points for Japan (1-1) as it put together an overwhelming fourth quarter to beat Finland (0-2) and eliminate the Finns from knockout-stage contention.</p>


<p>Japan outscored Finland 38-15 in the final 10:03, erasing what was a 13-point deficit. Yuki Kawamura scored 25 for Japan, including a three-point play with 4:35 left that gave the hosts the lead for good. He added a 3-pointer about 40 seconds later and Japan pulled away.</p>


<p>Lauri Markkanen topped Finland with 27 points and 12 rebounds.</p>

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">
MONTENEGRO 89, EGYPT 74
</div>

<p>At Manila, Nikola Vucevic had 16 points and seven rebounds and Montenegro (2-0) had little trouble with Egypt.</p>


<p>Nikola Ivanovic scored 15 for Montenegro, while Kendrick Perry scored 11 and Vladimir Mihailovic and Dino Radoncic finished with 10 apiece.</p>


<p>Ehab Amin led all scorers with 26 points for Egypt (0-2), while Anas Mahmoud and Patrick Gardner each finished with 13.</p>


<p>A major difference was points off turnovers: Montenegro turned Egypt’s 22 giveaways into 30 points, while Egypt managed 17 points off Montenegro’s 16 turnovers.</p>


<p>Montenegro plays Lithuania on Tuesday — both teams are going to the second round, and Tuesday will only decide who wins the group — while Egypt will take on Mexico.</p>

<div class="ns-block-custom-html">
GROUP D — LITHUANIA 96, MEXICO 66
</div>

<p>At Manila, Jonas Valanciunas had 15 points and 10 rebounds, Rokas Jokubaitis added 15 points and Lithuania (2-0) rolled into the second round.</p>


<p>Mindaugas Kuzminskas scored 14 for the winners, while Donatas Motiejunas and Ignas Brazdeikis each scored 10.</p>


<p>Gabriel Giron scored 13 for Mexico (0-2). Israel Gutierrez, Orlando Mendez and Pako Cruz had 10 apiece.</p>
