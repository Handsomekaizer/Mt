    <p>SANTA CLARA &#8212; How the 49ers&#8217; roster evolves from today through Feb. 11 will be fascinating, especially if they&#8217;re indeed playing at season&#8217;s end for the Lombardi Trophy in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s 53-man roster reveal was not fascinating, not shocking, and not troubling.</p>
<p>The 49ers made their biggest roster move four days earlier, when they unloaded quarterback Trey Lance on the Dallas Cowboys for a fourth-round pick. It was a combined effort to move on with other quarterbacks, grant him a trade, save a few million on next year&#8217;s salary cap, and, here it comes, take accountability and criticism for trading up in 2021 to the No. 3 pick for such a raw prospect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fortunately, we still have a really good football team that I think has a legitimate shot,&#8221; general manager John Lynch said Friday night. &#8220;We&#8217;re focused on Game 1, but we have a championship-level roster. Now it&#8217;s what we make of it.”</p>
<p>Lynch will have more to say about that roster when he and coach Kyle Shanahan meet separately with reporters before today&#8217;s 3 p.m. practice; next door, Beyoncé&#8217;s concert hits the Levi&#8217;s Stadium stage at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Roster depth and injury luck are fates the 49ers can&#8217;t answer, yet. So here are three issues with the roster at this point:</p>


<p>Nick Bosa&#8217;s name is not on the initial roster because, if you haven&#8217;t heard, he&#8217;s yet to report to the team. He skipped training camp and the preseason, as the 49ers expected, while awaiting a contract that makes him the NFL&#8217;s highest-paid non-quarterback.</p>
<p>Ideally, Bosa will sign and reunite with his teammates now that practices have transitioned into regular-season mode. Sessions are slated for Wednesday and Thursday, then comes Week 1 with practices Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday before their flight to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>What if Bosa&#8217;s holdout keeps him from playing in the season opener, which happened in 2017 with the Los Angeles Rams&#8217; and Aaron Donald? The 49ers did not stock up on defensive ends this offseason, instead spending big for defensive tackle Javon Hargrave to ideally ride shotgun with Bosa.</p>
<p>Drake Jackson and Clelin Ferrell are the top defensive ends on the roster; Kerry Hyder Jr. and Austin Bryant got released Tuesday but are expected to re-sign today, in paperwork shuffling. Three of last year&#8217;s defensive ends left town &#8212; Samson Ebukam (Colts), Charles Omenihu (Chiefs), Jordan Willis (Raiders; released Tuesday).</p>


<p>Is rookie kicker Jake Moody going on Injured Reserve and thus missing his first four NFL games because of a quadriceps injury, prompting the 49ers to sign, perhaps, Tristan Vizcaino or another free agent in the coming days? This is the most compelling drama outside of Bosa&#8217;s contract.</p>
<p>Of the 49ers&#8217; nine-man draft class, only two did not make the initial cut and instead are on injury lists: tight end Cameron Latu (third round) and cornerback Darrell Luter Jr. (fifth round).</p>
<p>Latu&#8217;s initial camp had far too many drops and penalties, but he caught Lance&#8217;s final touchdown pass in a 49ers uniform (in Aug. 19 preseason action), and then blew out a meniscus in his knee in Friday&#8217;s preseason finale. Redshirting him on Injured Reserve as a rookie is a smart route.</p>
<p>Luter hyperextended his knee in June, and he&#8217;ll be eligible to debut after four games, should the 49ers elect to activate him off the Physically Unable To Perform list.</p>
<p>Injured Reserve is also where the 49ers placed kicker Zane Gonzalez (calf), safety Tayler Hawkins (hand) and cornerback A.J. Parker (hamstring).</p>

<p>Fred Warner is the 49ers&#8217; defensive hype man, captain and leader of a crowded linebacker room. It includes veteran incumbents Dre Greenlaw, Oren Burks and Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles. The two rookie linebackers who got drafted, Jalen Graham (seventh round) and Dee Winters (sixth round), each made the roster. Left out were Marcelino McCrary-Ball and Curtis Robinson, the latter of whom took a lot of first-team reps in practice in place of Burks at strong-side linebacker.</p>
<p>So why is linebacker depth so important? Greenlaw (hamstring) and Burks (knee) have been recovering from injuries since the 49ers&#8217; first practice against the Raiders. Graham could be a surprise, strong-side starter in Week 1.</p>
<p>At wide receiver, veterans Willie Snead IV, Chris Conley and Anthony Miller missed the cut, as did Tay Martin and Isaiah Winstead on their likely way to the practice squad.</p>
<p>So the 49ers kept Danny Gray aboard despite a shoulder injury, keeping alive his shot at playing this season if they do move him to Injured Reserve. McCloud is only a few weeks removed from wrist surgery, but don&#8217;t be stunned if he rushes back and returns punts in 11 days.</p>
<p>The overall goal: Place as few players as possible onto Injured Reserve between now and Feb. 11.</p>
