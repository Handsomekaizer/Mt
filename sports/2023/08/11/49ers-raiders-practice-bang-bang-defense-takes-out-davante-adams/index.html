    <p>HENDERSON, Nev. &#8212; Davante Adams burst off the line and within seconds, Jimmy Garoppolo&#8217;s well-placed pass came his way, but so did 49ers defenders Oren Burks and Charvarius Ward.</p>
<p>The collision result: Adams limped off with a lower leg injury, eventually heading on his own for the locker room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately Adams went down,&#8221; 49ers defensive coordinator Steve Wilks said. &#8220;I thought it was a bang-bang play, definitely not intentional, and I hope he has a speedy recovery, because he’s one of the top players in the league.”</p>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s &#8220;not crazy serious,&#8221; as Raiders coach Josh McDaniels said, endangering a top player is always feared in summertime football, and Adams, a Bay Area native, is their offense&#8217;s best weapon.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not necessarily why the bulk of the 49ers&#8217; starting players will sit out Sunday&#8217;s preseason opener against the Raiders. Another driving factor is the starters&#8217; immense workload in Friday&#8217;s joint practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Brock Purdy will not play in Sunday’s opener at Allegiant Stadium, as Trey Lance will play most of the first half and Sam Darnold will handle most of the second-half duties, coach Kyle Shanahan said on KNBR 680-AM after practice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Practice, you get it raw, exactly what it&#8217;s going to be,&#8221; 49ers leading receiver Brandon Aiyuk said. &#8220;Games are a little different and there&#8217;s not as much one-on-one work.&#8221;</p>
<p>That especially goes for Purdy. He wasn&#8217;t perfect in either practice, but these desert duels did him well, especially in terms of the high pitch count he was able to handle with his surgically repaired right elbow.</p>
<p>Purdy was 17-of-26 Friday, with the low being an interception and the high being a touchdown pass to Deebo Samuel. More pertinent, Purdy served as the quarterback in 5-of-6 periods, amounting to 37 snaps for him.</p>
<p>Aiyuk added: &#8220;You get a period that might be good, one that might be alright. It&#8217;s pretty much that game situation where you go through the flows, the ups and downs, of a game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Left tackle Trent Williams is not concerned about the Purdy-led offense&#8217;s ups and downs. &#8220;Not at all. I have faith in coach. I have faith in Brock,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;It&#8217;s preseason and the guy just got back from six-month rehab. I&#8217;m definitely not putting too much into a practice rep or practice interception. I don&#8217;t think about it one second.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purdy&#8217;s workload Friday meant limited duty for Lance (1-of-2, five snaps), Darnold (3-of-3, four snaps) and No. 4 afterthought Brandon Allen (no full-team snaps).</p>
<p>The 49ers did not appear to sustain any serious injuries against the Raiders, although linebacker Dre Greenlaw left early from Thursday&#8217;s session with a hamstring issue that kept him out Friday.</p>


<p>The closest these former Bay Area neighbors came to squaring off with fists was when Samuel and Raiders&#8217; safety Tre’von Moehrig had to be separated. Overall, things were so civil that over 40 linemen from both teams merged to cool off inside a climate-controlled room in the midst of Friday&#8217;s practice.</p>
<p>Things were definitely more physical and less civil about 15 years ago when the Raiders hosted the 49ers in Napa, as Frank Gore attested after viewing Friday&#8217;s practice and recalling how hard he knocked Raiders linebackers around in that 2009 camp.</p>
<p>McDaniels liked how spirited and clean the practices went, adding that he&#8217;d be in favor of more in future years.</p>

<p>Maxx Crosby proved a worthy sparring partner for 49ers&#8217; All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams, who said: &#8220;Being able to work with him closely and get some dialogue back and forth, it helped both of us out. I have a lot of respect for his game and I&#8217;m a big fan of his. He&#8217;s slippery.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the closest thing we&#8217;ll get to not only game speed but Nick (Bosa). You know we miss him Nick and not having him every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Bosa entrenched in a contract dispute and not at camp, the 49ers&#8217; starting defensive ends Friday were Kerry Hyder Jr. and Clelin Ferrell; Drake Jackson (hamstring) remained out.</p>

<p>A month after turning 35, Williams moved closer to his goal of playing past 40.&#8221;I don’t know how realistic it is. We’ve seen people do it. It’s definitely a goal of mine,&#8221; said Williams, an All-Pro each of the last two years. &#8220;I want to see how long I can push this thing. I want to see how long I can stay at the top of my game, how long can I fight Father Time off. When he wins, you’ll know he wins, and I’ll hang them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;But at age 38, 39, 41, I’m not going to leave anything in the tank. So if I feel I have something to offer to the game, I’m going to be suiting up. &#8230; If Kyle tells me, &#8216;Hey, I think it&#8217;s time, you had a great career,&#8217; then it&#8217;s time. As long as I&#8217;m working for the San Francisco 49ers and I feel up to doing it, I&#8217;m going to do it as long as I can, as hard as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Left tackle Jaylon Moore returned from a bruised knee and worked at left tackle, where he is vying for a backup role with Matt Pryor and Leroy Watson. &#8230; Wide receiver Danny Gray did not practice for a second straight day because of soreness. &#8230; Running back Elijah Mitchell and tight end George Kittle did not practice because of adductor (groin) injuries. &#8230; Rookie defensive end Robert Beal Jr. (hamstring) returned to limited action.</p>

<p>While Christian McCaffrey had an ample amount of touches (six runs, three catches) in a pass-heavy practice, Ty Davis-Price is looking like a valid backup. Davis-Price scored on a run and a reception. &#8230; Cameron Latu atoned for dropping a potential Lance touchdown pass Thursday by nabbing one from him in Friday&#8217;s 7-on-7 drills. Lance&#8217;s next pass got intercepted by Duke Shelley. &#8230; Purdy&#8217;s running ability saw him scramble for a fourth-and-1 conversion, and later score on a quarterback draw in a red-zone drill &#8230;. Aiyuk had a team-high four receptions, followed by Deebo Samuel (three), Kyle Juszczyk (two) and Jauan Jennings (two). &#8230; Robert Spillane intercepted a Purdy pass that went low toward Willie Snead IV. &#8230; Defensive lineman Breeland Speaks, a NFL journeyman but more recently the USFL’s sack leader, made his practice debut upon signing   a one-year deal. &#8230; Cornerback Anthony Averett went on Injured Reserve.</p>

<p>Mike Shanahan strolled the Raiders’ practice field once again, nearly 35 years after serving as their coach. Only this time, he wore a bright red, 49ers polo shirt with his black shorts, as he watched his son, Kyle, operate a well-scripted practice in his seventh year as the 49ers’ coach.</p>
<p>Late Raiders czar Al Davis fired the older Shanahan after a 1-3 start in 1989, and a 7-9 mark his previous season. Mike Shanahan went on to win multiple Super Bowl, as the 49ers offensive coordinator (1994) and the Denver Broncos coach (1997, ’98), and he is a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s coach/contributor category. The Raiders interviewed him in 2015 before hiring Jack Del Rio.</p>
