    <p>SANTA CLARA &#8212; Yes, Brock Purdy had a pass intercepted Tuesday, a mistake that has occurred in most of his practices in an otherwise remarkable comeback from elbow surgery.</p>
<p>Making this one different was who snagged it on the 49ers&#8217; practice field.</p>
<p>Talanoa Hufanga, flashing his All-Pro form from last season, correctly diagnosed where Purdy was aiming a short throw and picked it off in stride before the ball reached tight end Troy Fumagalli.</p>
<p>Hufanga and Purdy have lockers near each other, and they often review plays together in their educational pursuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he’s throwing us one, it’s helping us get better, and it’s helping him learn,&#8221; Hufanga said. &#8220;I’m first one to pick his brain: &#8216;Why did I do that? What could I have done better?&#8217; For him to learn from it and me to learn from it, that’s what makes it so competitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s lesson: Hufanta was in man coverage and jumped the route, knowing that &#8220;the clock was going off&#8221; as Purdy had to get rid of the ball against a pass rush, to which Hufanga deferred credit on the play.</p>
<p>Hufanga actually bobbled the ball briefly as he raced toward the end zone for a would-be touchdown, reminiscent of his pick-six in last October&#8217;s home win over the Los Angeles Rams.</p>
<p>A year ago, Hufanga was coming off a part-time role as a rookie and No. 3 safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last year was a big learning curve, coming from my rookie year (when) I was learning four different positions,&#8221; Hufanga said. &#8220;Then adjusting to last year’s role of just being a safety and understanding my job and allowing other guys to make plays.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of me was overthinking as a rookie,&#8221; Hufanga added. &#8220;Now I’m trying to grasp everything and play free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purdy was otherwise pretty sharp, starting 12-of-14 Tuesday, including a pass that appeared to ricochet off Deommodore Lenoir and into the hands of Deebo Samuel.</p>
<p>This was the start of Purdy practicing three consecutive days for the first time since March elbow surgery.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has that chip on the shoulder to go out there and play his game,&#8221; Hufanga said. &#8220;I love it. That’s how he commands the room and the team.&#8221;</p>
<p>Purdy capped his 16-of-20 practice with strikes to Charlie Woerner, Samuel, Kyle Juszczyk and Brandon Aiyuk. On that final 29-yard throw to Aiyuk against Ambry Thomas&#8217; coverage at the goal line, Purdy got solid protection, especially as Aaron Banks came over with a fierce double-team block on Clelin Ferrell.</p>
<p>Purdy didn&#8217;t get off a throw on play that was was whistled dead on a sack, in which Ferrell, Arik Armstead and Javon Hargrave swarmed the pocket.</p>

<p>Sam Darnold rotated first as the No. 2 quarterback, and his highlight on a 5-of-6 day was a 40-yard completion to Danny Gray, who returned from a tight hip last week.</p>
<p>Trey Lance was 4-of-7, scrambled a few times, and he finished with an overthrow of Ronnie Bell when pressured by Robert Beal Jr.</p>
<p>Brandon Allen was excused from practice; he flew to Florida after Sunday’s game for the expected birth of his second son.</p>

<p>Rookie kicker Jake Moody made 5-of-6 field-goal attempts in practice as he rebounded from Sunday’s debut, in which he missed his two field-goal attempts. Moody made good Tuesday from 59, 34, 56, 53, and 43; his only miss was a 61-yard attempt wide left.</p>

<p>Bell, a seventh-round draft pick, acknowledged that his Sunday debut was marred a fourth-quarter drop that led to an interception. That said, he also had three catches, returned two punts and averaged 19 yards on three kick returns.</p>
<p>“I felt like I was comfortable and that was a goal of mine. When you turn on the film and watch for assignment and alignment, I was comfortable and doing the right thing. (As a punt returner), I thought I did a good job squaring up the ball and making a clean catch. But I could have done better.”</p>

<p>Returning to practice were defensive ends Drake Jackson and Robert Beal, the latter of whom pressured Lance on his overthrow to Bell on Tuesday’s final throw. … Left tackle Trent Williams practiced through an early ankle issue. … Conditioning on the side field were tight end George Kittle (groin), running back Elijah Mitchell (groin) and linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring).</p>
