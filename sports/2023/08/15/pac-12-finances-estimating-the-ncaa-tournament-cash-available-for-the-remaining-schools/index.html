    <p>Before the &#8216;Pac-4&#8217; schools begin their home renovation &#8212; if, in fact, they choose that option &#8212; the quartet must establish a budget. How much cash would Cal, Stanford, Oregon State and Washington State have available to offset expenses and attract expansion candidates?</p>
<p>The details are unknown. Less than two weeks after the collapse of the conference, the financial officers and general counsels are plowing through budgets, bank accounts and bylaws.</p>
<p>Which schools have voting rights and thus control the assets?</p>
<p>How significant are the liabilities?</p>
<p>What resources are available for the rebuild?</p>
<p>One revenue stream is clear: The remaining schools would own the NCAA Tournament units earned by the outgoing members.</p>
<p>“Those shares stay with the conference,” Oregon State athletic director Scott Barnes said recently. “It’s one of the many valuable assets we have.”</p>
<p>Each game played by a conference in March Madness equals one unit. Those units translate to dollars and are paid out over a rolling six-year cycle through the NCAA Basketball Fund.</p>
<p>For now, let’s assume the NCAA distributions to the Pac-12 in the spring of 2024 will be split 12 ways, with the outgoing schools receiving equal shares. (Clarity on financial and administrative issues should come in the next few weeks.)</p>
<p>But the units earned won’t follow them out the door. All that cash will be left to the four remaining members, <em>if</em> they stick together. (At this point, it&#8217;s unclear what would happen to the units if the conference disbands.)</p>
<p>How much cash? Our focus here is the NCAA Tournament distribution in 2025, when the ‘Pac-4’ would be in greatest need of cash.</p>
<p>The units are paid out on a one-year delay, so the total amount received in 2025 will depend on the units earned over the previous six years — the NCAA Tournaments played in 2019-2024.</p>
<p>The Pac-12 earned just seven units in 2019 but generated a whopping 19 units in 2021, then seven in both the 2022 and 2023 events. (COVID forced the cancellation of the 2020 event, so there were no units available.)</p>
<p>Obviously, we cannot know the unit total earned by the Pac-12 in 2024 until the upcoming spring, so let’s estimate. We’ll average the units from the other years in the six-year payout cycle and assign that figure to 2024.</p>
<p>Which gives us the following units to be paid out to the four remaining members in the spring of 2025:</p>
<p>2019: 7<br />
2020: N/A<br />
2021: 19<br />
2022: 7<br />
2023: 7<br />
2024: 10<br />
<strong>Total: 50</strong></p>
<p>The dollar value of each unit increases over time by approximately 3 percent annually. Let’s estimate $350,000 per unit, based on the value assigned in 2023.</p>
<p>Those 50 units would result in $17.5 million distributed to the Pac-12 in the 2025 payout cycle.</p>
<p>Were that amount split 12 ways, it would equal $1.46 million per school.</p>
<p>But only the remaining schools would be entitled to the distribution. Split four ways, it&#8217;s $4.38 million per school — a difference of about $3 million per campus.</p>
<p>The schools could keep that extra cash for themselves, to offset the loss of media rights revenue, or use it for the rebuilding project.</p>
<p>After all, $12 million might come in handy if an expansion candidate needs help covering the cost of an exit fee from its conference.</p>
<p>(In theory, the newcomers could receive a share of the NCAA revenue generated before they joined the conference, but that would be part of the expansion negotiations.)</p>

<p>Any schools leaving the Mountain West, for example, would owe $34 million in order to join the Pac-12 in time for the 2024 football season and $17 million to join for the 2025 season.</p>
<p>And don’t forget: The payout cycle encompasses six years on a rolling basis.</p>
<p>The Pac-12&#8217;s remaining schools will have access to units earned by UCLA, Arizona and the other departing programs until 2030.</p>
<p>Based on the units generated by the 12 schools to date &#8212; and using our estimated total for 2024 &#8212; the conference will receive $65.6 million from the NCAA over the payout period.</p>
<p>Again, we offer the splits:</p>
<p>&#8212; With no changes to membership, that would mean $5.5 million per school.</p>
<p>&#8212; But if paid only to Cal, Stanford, Oregon State and Washington State, that’s $16.4 million — a difference of $11 million per campus.</p>
<p>If that excess cash were pooled, then used to fund expansion or offset lost media rights revenue, the Pac-12 would have $44 million available to support the renovation.</p>
