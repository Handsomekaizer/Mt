    <p>Cal chancellor Carol Christ heard a loud knock on her hotel door before dawn Friday morning in San Diego, where she was scheduled to meet with donors.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s someone from the hotel saying there was an urgent call, and I was thinking, &#8216;What catastrophe has happened?&#8217; But it turned out to be this very good news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cal was headed to the ACC.</p>
<p>University presidents of the Charlotte-based conference approved membership offers to Cal and Stanford, ending a lengthy reverse courtship in which the Bay Area schools sought salvation following the demise of the Pac-12. (SMU is joining the Bears and Cardinal to give the ACC 18 members.)</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been a month of frenzied activity,&#8221; Christ said Friday morning during a Zoom interview. &#8220;I’ve been joking that Kumbaya has turned into &#8216;Lord of the Flies&#8217; rather quickly as everybody tried to find a landing place with the increasing instability of the Pac-12.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s been probably as intense a period as I’ve had in my professional life. (It&#8217;s) surprising to me, given everything the university does, that it’s about athletics. But I feel very good about the result.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that the Bears have secured a home for their teams through the 2035-36 sports season, all they have to do is pay for it.</p>
<p>Membership in the ACC comes at a price, for the Bay Area schools will receive reduced revenue shares from their new league for nine years.</p>
<p>Cal described the arrangement in the following manner (without specific dollar amounts):</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The university will receive a full share of all revenues, including media revenue, while contributing back a portion of its media revenue to support and strengthen the conference and its current member institutions. UC Berkeley&#8217;s membership contribution will taper off until the 10th year, at which point it will begin retaining 100% of its media revenue share.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Over time, the Bears&#8217; cash deficit relative to the ACC&#8217;s existing members could exceed $75 million, based on estimates in published media reports and the publicly known details of the league&#8217;s revenue streams.</p>
<p>In fact, Cal likely will receive several million dollars less per year than the Bears have been collecting in the Pac-12.</p>
<p>&#8220;There certainly are financial challenges to this agreement,&#8221; Christ said. &#8220;We believe this was the best agreement in financial terms that we could have made and look forward to working through the challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, for an athletic department that lives on the dollar&#8217;s edge and requires massive help from central campus to balance its book.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Christ and athletic director Jim Knowlton devised a plan by which the university would provide $22 million in direct support to athletics with the goal of reducing the amount &#8220;down to $13 million over a period of years,&#8221; Christ said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously, we have to rethink that in the context of the current agreement we will have with the ACC. But we still don&#8217;t have all the pieces on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those pieces is the level of support Cal might receive from UCLA.</p>
<p>In December, the University of California Board of Regents granted themselves the authority to impose a so-called Berkeley tax on the Westwood campus, allowing a portion of UCLA&#8217;s revenue from the Big Ten to be earmarked for Cal.</p>

<p>The level of support ranges from $2 million to $10 million. While the regents didn&#8217;t commit to enforcing the subsidy, the collapse of the Pac-12 combined with the reduced revenue shares from the ACC and the potential for added travel costs to the East Coast seemingly makes the Berkeley tax inevitable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can’t give you specifics,&#8221; Christ said. &#8220;I think the regents are going to return to this issue. The agreement they made in December was awaiting the media contract Cal was getting (in the Pac-12). It’s a regents decision, and the regents haven&#8217;t made that specific decision yet. But I expect they will sometime soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked if she would be open to increasing the level of campus support for Cal athletics in the wake of the ACC agreement, Christ said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s too early to comment on that. We’ve barely begun to think about strategy. There’s a piece of it that’s missing, which is what the regents decide about UCLA’s contribution to Cal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cal athletic director Jim Knowlton added that he is working with Christ &#8220;on how to continue to support at an exceptional level our student athletes in all our sports. It’s certainly going to be a process.&#8221;</p>
