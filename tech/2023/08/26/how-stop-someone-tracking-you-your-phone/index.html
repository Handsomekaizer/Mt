    <p>How would you feel if someone were spying on your every move, possibly listening to your conversations, and maybe even accessing your personal data without your consent? Would you even know if that were happening to you? We recently received this intriguing email from Marybeth of Wilmington, Delaware: </p> <p><i>"Is there a way to determine if someone has installed tracking software on your phone?</i> </p> <p><i>- Marybeth, Wilmington, DE"</i> </p>  <p>This is such a great question, because the last thing you want is for the wrong person to know your every move. Sharing your location with people from your cell phone should happen with your consent and only with people you trust, not creeps who have found sneaky ways to track you. </p> <p>First, let’s answer Marybeth’s question right off the bat. Yes, there are some ways to determine whether someone has installed tracking software on your phone. Here are some signs that you can look for: </p>  <p>The truth is that, yes, your phone can be tracked. Sometimes, unsavory characters will find ways to hack into your device to see where you're going. Other times, you might have apps on your phone that are tracking your location in the background without you even realizing it. </p> <p>Whatever the case may be, there are ways that you may be able to tell when someone has hacked into your device and is tracking you. </p>  <p>A <strong>list of apps</strong> that you have permitted to track your activity will appear here. You can turn off ones that have no use tracking you by toggling off, like <strong>Twitter or Instagram. </strong>However, apps that actively use location services like <strong>Uber and Door Dash</strong> should be left on so that you can be located when using them. </p> <p><i><strong>How to turn off app tracking on an Android </strong></i></p> <p><i>Settings may vary depending on your Android phone’s manufacturer </i> </p> <p>And if you want to learn more about how you can stop sharing your location with others, you can click here. </p> <p>No, it's not an individual, but you don't want big tech tracking you either. Your Google account could have a history of devices that are tracking you, and Google has been known to collect tons of data about your location history, web and app activity and more. However, you can make sure that your location settings are adjusted so that this doesn't happen without your consent. </p>  <p><i><strong>How to adjust the location settings in your Google account (iPhone) </strong></i></p> <p><i><strong>How to adjust the location settings in your Google account (Android) </strong></i></p>  <p>You should make sure that your phone is always locked when you're not using it. Create strong passwords for your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. Consider using a password manager to securely store and generate complex passwords. </p> <p>Along with a strong password, you should also have facial recognition or fingerprint enabled, depending on what your smartphone offers. This prevents unauthorized access to your phone and the installation of tracking apps. Be sure to enable 2-factor authentication or 2FA, which is a security method that requires two forms of identification, as an extra shield that will prevent a hacker from getting into your accounts. </p> <p>Make sure you're always checking for software updates on your phone if you don't have automatic updates turned on already. You can do this by going into your phone's settings and checking for software updates. These updates often have important security and bug fixes that can further prevent your phone from being hacked. You should also be regularly checking for updates to all the apps on your phone, as those will get security and bug fixes as well. </p> <p>Google is the default browser for tons of people on the internet. However, the tech giant has also been known to keep track of people's data so that it can send more targeted ads. That's why there are some great alternatives for your desktop and laptop browsers as well as your mobile devices that you can use to browse freely without having to worry about your data being taken. </p> <p>The big nightmare that we all want to avoid is having someone tracking our every move. It's an invasion of privacy and can be incredibly scary and anxiety-inducing, so make sure you're following my tips carefully and keeping those criminals out of your business. </p> <p>Should apps that don't need your location even have the option to turn it on? Let us know by writing us at Cyberguy.com/Contact. </p> <p>For more of my tech tips and security alerts, subscribe to my free CyberGuy Report Newsletter by heading to Cyberguy.com/Newsletter. </p> <p><i>Copyright 2023 CyberGuy.com. All rights reserved. </i></p>
