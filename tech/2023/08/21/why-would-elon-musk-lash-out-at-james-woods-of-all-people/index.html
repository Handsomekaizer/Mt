    <p>Even though James Woods was one of Elon Musk&#8217;s biggest celebrity supporters when the Tesla CEO took over the social media site formerly known as Twitter, Musk showed that he wasn&#8217;t so inclined to reciprocate the actor&#8217;s good will and gracefully accept his criticism of his pledge to remove the platform&#8217;s &#8220;block&#8221; option.</p>
<p>Musk, apparently being Musk, told Woods to &#8220;delete your account.&#8221; Musk then hit &#8220;block&#8221; on Woods &#8212; the very button the two men had been arguing about, the Daily Beast reported. Perhaps being thin-skinned, Musk didn&#8217;t take too kindly to Woods calling him a &#8220;greedy capitalist&#8221; and dismissing his claims of being a defender of free speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Musk, whom I once championed, is only doing this to protect his advertisers anyway,&#8221; Woods said on X Saturday about the proposal to end the &#8220;block&#8221; feature. &#8220;Users of X are mere pawns to turn the site into an electronic shopping mall. The man I thought was a defender of free speech is just another greedy capitalist. Disappointing, but not surprising.&#8221;</p>
<p>After Musk blocked Woods, the actor wrote, &#8220;(Your) prerogative, sir, which is exactly my point. Have a nice day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 20, 2023</p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to gauge why Musk so cavalierly lashed out at a celebrity fan who has 3.4 million followers and who shares many of his conservative, anti-woke sensibilities. One X user called Musk&#8217;s move &#8220;bizarro,&#8221; but Musk also likes to play provocateur and is &#8220;ever a bundle of contradictions and inconsistencies,&#8221; as the New York Times once said.</p>
<p>As the New York Post and the Daily Beast reported, Musk and Woods began arguing on X Friday after Musk mused on the possibility of removing the block button and Woods disparaged this plan. Doing so, the double-Oscar nominee said, would make the site “untenable” for public figures such as himself.</p>
<p>“In the midst of a libel suit I was targeted by 30 trolls the defendant enlisted to harass me,” Woods wrote in an X post on Saturday. “X will be untenable for people like me, who are willing to share their identities. If he does this, I will have no choice but to retire from this site.&#8221;</p>
<p>When a supporter of Woods responded to the post, writing that “we got to make sure that doesn’t happen. You&#8217;re one of the most important people on here,&#8221; Woods responded, &#8220;If @elonmuskremoves the ability to block concerted harassment by trolls or organized political entities, how will &#8216;X&#8217; be any different from Jack Dorsey’s horrid Twitter?&#8221;</p>
<p>After Woods confirmed that Musk blocked him, he expressed gratitude to his supporters and insisted that he didn&#8217;t really plan to go anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recurring theme in your many heartfelt DM’s was a fear that I would leave X,&#8221; Woods told his followers. &#8220;I’ve have now decided I will never leave, and will only ever be silent when they find an excuse to remove my account.”</p>
<p>Woods also said he had &#8220;battled the oppressive boot of censorship before, and will continue until the Stasi at X find an excuse to bury me for good.&#8221; Woods is no doubt referring to the times he was suspended or blocked from Twitter when he posted politically-themed messages that were said to be misleading or tinged with conspiracy theories and in violation of the platform&#8217;s terms of service, Newsweek reported. </p>
<p>For this so-called battle against &#8220;the oppressive boot&#8221; of Musk&#8217;s censorship, Woods received support from people in divergent political circles. Some were Musk fans, the New York Post reported.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a huge mistake,” the pro-Musk X account known as “Wall Street Silver&#8221; wrote. &#8220;Block is a critical feature on this app. &#8230; There are certain evil people that users just don&#8217;t want following them or replying to them. Scammers, cyber stalkers, etc. I suspect many people would abandon X if they can&#8217;t block the harassing accounts out of their lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a different perspective, Monica Lewinsky also wrote about the dangers of removing the block feature: &#8220;Please rethink removing the block feature. as an anti-bullying activist (and target of harassment) i can assure you it’s a critical tool to keep people safe online.&#8221;</p>
<p>Musk responded to his critics on Sunday with taunts, writing that it was “pretty fun blocking people who complain that blocking is going away.”</p>
<p>But X users in turn by responded by saying that Musk would essentially be shooting himself in the foot. They wrote &#8220;a community note” — which allows posters to offer clarifications and corrections on content that could be misleading — which states that doing away with the “block” feature could be a violation of the terms of service of Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store,&#8221; the New York Post said.</p>
