    <p>The mother of a man accused of murder in the Florida panhandle is now also behind bars after police discovered text messages allegedly showing her help plan the shooting death of a woman working inside The Home Depot.</p> <p>Keith Agee, 20, was arrested by the Escambia County Sheriff's Office Friday afternoon in connection with the deadly shooting of 18-year-old Brooklyn Sims hours earlier at the home improvement retailer on Davis Highway in Pensacola. Police did not share the relationship between Agee and Sims, but Pensacola news outlet WEAR said the two have a 2-year-old daughter together.</p> <p>The sheriff's office revealed Monday night that Agee's 50-year-old mother, Sheila, was involved in planning the targeted attack.</p> <p>"According to text messages, it’s clear that Keith Agee’s mother, Sheila Agee, knew and participated in the plan to kill Brooklyn Sims. Additionally, text messages between mother and son highlight the mother’s involvement in helping locate the victim," the ECSO wrote on Facebook.</p>  <p>The department released the alleged text messages between the mother and son on its Facebook page, claiming they took place right before Sims was shot and killed.</p> <p>"The murder itself is unbelievable, but to know the mother knew about it and helped coordinate it is incomprehensible," Sheriff Chip Simmons said via Facebook.</p>  <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> The following conversation made public by the Escambia County Sheriff's Office contains explicit language and violence. Fox News Digital did not correct the messages for incorrect grammar, punctuation or spelling.</p> <p><i>Keith: "S--- ain’t do nun but cost me money and gave me a ------- I’m fin just shoot her Ik I hate that for [daughter] buh like I said I can’t take it idgaf Nomo."</i></p> <p><i>Sheila: "Ok."</i></p> <p><i>Sheila: "Ok I’ll call you and tell you mf if you want to go to jail I’ll tell you when we get close but if you don’t come kill her you a mf b----."</i></p> <p><i>Sheila: "Don’t call nanny and tell her she will try and talk you out of it."</i></p> <p><i>Keith: "Ian even gon tell her y I left."

It don’t affect me either f-----g way."</i></p> <p>Keith was arrested shortly after the shooting Friday and charged with aggravated battery and homicide, Escambia County Jail records show. He remains in jail on no bond.</p> <p>The sheriff's office announced Monday night that Sheila was arrested in Washington County, Alabama, for principal to first-degree murder and will be extradited back to Florida. Her arrest came after she attended a balloon release for Sims in Cintronelle, Alabama, according to WEAR.</p>
