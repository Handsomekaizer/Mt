    <p>Law enforcement released interview tapes with the prime suspect of the infamous 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders, which claimed the lives of seven people.</p> <p>The victims ingested Extra Strength Tylenol capsules that was later learned to be laced with potassium cyanide, a highly toxic chemical asphyxiant that interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen and causes rapid death.</p> <p>More than four decades later, the case remains unsolved, and the prime suspect — James Lewis — died last month at the age of 76.</p> <p>In the video interview, Lewis appears relaxed as he reclines on his couch in his underwear and T-shirt, leg propped up and body slouched into the cushions as he theorized how someone as young as a teenager could have carried out the Tylenol murders without being caught.</p>  <p>For decades, Lewis denied any involvement in the killings, and he was never convicted of the murders. </p> <p>But he was found guilty of extorting Johnson &amp; Johnson when he sent a $1 million ransom note to the Tylenol manufacturer to "stop the killing," and spent more than 12 years in prison.</p>   <p>"Sounds to me like somebody did a pre-mix. Open the bottle, toss [the capsules] in, walk to the next shelf, or the next store, or whatever. That would cut down their standing time at the shelf an awful lot."</p> <p>An FBI agent countered with, "You are creating the perfect criminal, a 15-year-old, who doesn't make an error."</p> <p>"It’s probably so obvious it’d make everyone here feel stupid that we didn’t think of it," Lewis said about halfway through the two-hour interview. </p> <p>The Tylenol murders created a worldwide panic and led to reforms in how over-the-counter medicines are packaged as the FDA introduced new tamper-proof packaging like foil seals.</p> <p>Before that, it was easy to remove the top and cotton with a paper clip without leaving DNA traces, Lewis suggested in the video. </p>  <p>"The clip goes underneath it, you lift … lid's like this, hooks over on the end, take the paper clip, put it in there, lift it up," Lewis said.</p> <p>"In real life, it's a much easier way to open a bottle, a box like that, like than with a (finger)nail," which is what the FBI agent originally floated as a theory.</p> <p>"I think the person could do it in less than a minute right there in the store," Lewis said.</p> <p><strong>WATCH: "YOU GUYS WERE TOO DAMN STUPID"</strong></p> <p>There were several long pauses through this interaction, and the FBI agent continued to paint the scene by saying this hypothetical 15-year-old would have to be aware of all his surroundings while doing this.</p> <p>Lewis brushed it off as an easy workaround. </p> <p>After about an hour, the FBI agent talks about a time when some of the poisoned Extra Strength Tylenol capsules were found in Regular Strength Tylenol bottles and vice versa.</p> <p>"There's an example of a lack of perfection you guys didn't know what to do with," Lewis said. </p>  <p>"(The killer) made a mistake, a big blunder, and you guys didn’t figure out what to do with. This person isn't this perfect person you guys want to talk about. That's a major, major mistake.</p> <p>"You guys were too damn stupid to realize that it's not the same product. … And if he made that mistake, he probably made others that was equally as stupid, but you guys didn't see it."</p> <p>He said law enforcement "didn't exploit it" enough and suggested a segment on the news to draw him out. </p> <p>Mary Kellerman, 12, took an Extra Strength Tylenol after coming down with a sore throat and runny nose Sept. 29, 1982. </p> <p>Hours later, she was dead. </p> <p>Over the next several days, six more people in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/chicago" target="_blank"><u>Chicago area</u></a> suddenly died after taking what was then the best-selling non-prescription pain reliever.</p> <p>The other victims were identified as Adam Janus, Stanley Janus, Theresa Janus, Mary Reiner, Mary McFarland and Paula Prince</p> <p>Police have said they believe Lewis wanted revenge against Johnson &amp; Johnson after his 5-year-old daughter, Toni, died in 1974 after the sutures used to fix her congenital heart defect tore.</p> <p>A subsidiary of the company made the sutures that were supposed to fix Toni's congenital heart defect.</p>  <p>The bottles that had been tampered with all came from different factories, yet the victims were all within the Chicago area, according to crimemuseum.org. </p> <p>That "meant that the tampering had not occurred at the production level, but rather within the stores themselves."</p> <p>Helen Jensen, a nurse who helped treat the first victims at a suburban Chicago hospital, said in a phone interview with The Associated Press after Lewis’ July 2023 death that she hoped this would be a "conclusion" to the infamous cold case.</p> <p>"Not necessarily the conclusion everyone wanted," said Jensen, who is now retired. "But it is an end. I’m 86 now. And I am glad I got to see the end before I die."</p> <p>She was among the first to realize the Tylenol capsules were tampered with. </p> <p>The case "changed the world," Jensen told The Associated Press, which reported that she fully believes Lewis was behind the murders.</p> <p>"We lost our innocence," she told the news outlet. "We have become less trusting of everyone else. We can blame it all on him. … He was a terrorist, and we have suffered from his terror for 40 years."</p> <p>The murders prompted medication manufacturers to introduce tamper-resistant bottles with foil seals and other features that make it easy for consumers to tell whether a container has been altered. </p> <p>In 1989, the FDA created federal guidelines that required all manufacturers to make over-the-counter medications tamper-resistant.</p>
