    <p>Police in Las Vegas have released a dramatic bodycam video showing the moment an officer opened fire at a suspect who authorities say slashed his partner in the face with a knife. </p> <p>The officer-involving shooting that claimed the life of Sandra Lopez-Ochoa happened last Friday and was the fifth of its kind this year, according to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Sheriff Sasha Larkin. </p> <p>Larkin said Officer Rudy Sacba and his partner were sent to an apartment complex around 1 a.m. after a man called dispatch and "stated his sister had battered him." Minutes later, Lopez-Ochoa, 25, also called police to report a "domestic disturbance." </p> <p>When they arrived, after speaking with the brother, Larkin said police determined probable cause to arrest Lopez-Ochoa for domestic strangulation. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/las-vegas-man-arrested-after-allegedly-killing-girlfriend-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>LAS VEGAS MAN ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY KILLING GIRLFRIEND AT HOME</strong></a><strong> </strong></p> <p>They then went inside an apartment where they found her sitting on the couch in a living room, according to police. </p> <p>Larkin said when Sacba’s partner grabbed Lopez-Ochoa's arm to handcuff her, she reached down, grabbed a knife and slashed the officer in the top of the forehead. </p> <p>Sacba, a 32-year-old officer who has been with LVMPD since 2021, then drew his Glock 17 9mm and fired five rounds, striking Lopez-Ochoa, she added. </p> <p>First responders pronounced the suspect dead at the scene while the officer was taken to a local hospital for treatment before discharge. </p> <p>That officer is now at home recovering with his family after suffering a wound that Larkin said was "more than superficial." </p> <p>Footage released by LVMPD begins with Lopez-Ochoa sitting on a couch and saying "um, but can I like tell my part?" </p> <p>"Yeah. That’s what I was going to ask you about," the officer says. </p> <p>"Oh, OK," she responds. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/police-release-swat-video-raid-linked-tupac-shakur-murder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>POLICE RELEASE SWAT VIDEO OF RAID LINKED TO TUPAC SHAKUR MURDER</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>  <p>Lopez-Ochoa then starts talking before stopping and pointing at Sacba, asking him to take his hand off his holster. </p> <p>"I’m sorry, can you just like, not, like, touch your gun or something?" she says. </p> <p>"It’s actually on his holster, it’s something that we do, it’s nothing, it’s not like we are going..." Sacba’s partner responds. </p> <p>"No, I’m asking you that," Lopez-Ochoa then says to Sacba. </p> <p>"I’m going to keep it here, I’m just resting my hand, I’m not holding the gun," he tells her. </p> <p>Lopez-Ochoa then stands up from the couch and Sacba’s partner asks for her to put her hands behind her back when she lunges at him with a knife. </p> <p>After the shots ring out, the officer who was slashed is seen touching his forehead to examine the wound. Blood is seen dripping down from an area above his eyebrow. </p> <p>"Hey, are you good?" Sacba yells. </p> <p>"Yeah," the officer responds. </p> <p>Larkin said if Lopez-Ochoa survived, she would have been charged with battery/strangulation, attempted murder on a first responder and assault with a deadly weapon on a first responder. </p>
