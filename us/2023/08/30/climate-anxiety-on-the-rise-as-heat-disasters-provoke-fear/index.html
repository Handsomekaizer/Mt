<p>Britt Wray’s&nbsp;fears about a warming planet came&nbsp;to a head&nbsp;in 2017&nbsp;when she and her&nbsp;partner&nbsp;first&nbsp;talked&nbsp;about&nbsp;having a baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wray&nbsp;worked as a&nbsp;science&nbsp;communicator&nbsp;at the time&nbsp;and was&nbsp;bombarded with scientific reports on climate change “day in and day&nbsp;out," as&nbsp;well as reading several bombshell articles on the subject that came out that year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It was really this question of do I sit with the&nbsp;uncertainty&nbsp;of how bad this all might get and how nations will&nbsp;respond&nbsp;and powerholders will potentially&nbsp;act responsibly at some point,” said Wray, who now works as an instructor on climate and mental health at the Stanford University School of Medicine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do I feel okay bringing a child into this situation?&nbsp;With disasters piling up and so on so forth ... that really unleashed my own climate distress volcano.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wray, who ended up&nbsp;writing&nbsp;a book&nbsp;on climate anxiety, is not alone in her feelings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Climate distress,&nbsp;or eco-anxiety,&nbsp;is growing among Americans.&nbsp;Since 2012, the number of Americans who report feeling&nbsp;climate change is an “urgent threat” has&nbsp;more than&nbsp;doubled,&nbsp;jumping from&nbsp;12 to 26 percent, according to research from&nbsp;The Yale Program on Climate Change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;share&nbsp;of people who&nbsp;are&nbsp;frequently&nbsp;distressed by climate change is also going up:&nbsp;About&nbsp;10 percent of Americans now feel nervous, anxious or on edge about global warming at least several days of the week,&nbsp;according to&nbsp;a&nbsp;2022 report&nbsp;from the research center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Mental health professionals are increasingly reporting that their patients are talking about it,” said Susan&nbsp;Clayton,&nbsp;a psychology&nbsp;and environmental studies professor&nbsp;at the College of Wooster.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While anyone can suffer from climate distress, children and young adults are more likely to worry about the effects of climate change than older people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One&nbsp;2021 study&nbsp;on climate anxiety,&nbsp;which&nbsp;Wray&nbsp;help conduct, surveyed 10,000 young people between the ages of&nbsp;16 and 25 in 10 different countries,&nbsp;including United States,&nbsp;on their feelings about climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The survey found that respondents in all countries were worried about&nbsp;it.&nbsp;Nearly 60 percent&nbsp;said they were very or extremely worried,&nbsp;while an even larger majority of&nbsp;84 percent said they were at least&nbsp;moderately&nbsp;worried.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over half of&nbsp;the&nbsp;young people&nbsp;who were surveyed&nbsp;said they felt sad, anxious, angry, powerless,&nbsp;helpless&nbsp;and guilty in relation to climate change.&nbsp;More&nbsp;than 45 percent said their feelings about&nbsp;it&nbsp;negatively&nbsp;impacted&nbsp;their daily life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A 2020 survey&nbsp;of child psychiatrists in England found that&nbsp;57 percent&nbsp;were seeing&nbsp;children&nbsp;and young people who felt distressed about climate change and the state of the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wray and other climate&nbsp;experts&nbsp;agree that climate distress will&nbsp;likely continue&nbsp;to increase as&nbsp;the consequences of rising global temperatures become more frequent and visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So far in 2023, there have been 15 extreme weather and climate disaster events in the United States alone, according to the&nbsp;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&nbsp;— and climate change promises to keep making such disasters more likely, and more intense.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>What does climate anxiety look like?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>There are&nbsp;different levels&nbsp;of climate distress.&nbsp;Those who have gone through a climate disaster are the most likely to suffer from the most extreme eco-anxiety, according to&nbsp;Wray.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lowest level,&nbsp;meanwhile,&nbsp;is a “heightened” worry about how climate change is happening and that although&nbsp;it's&nbsp;unclear what the outcomes will be, they will certainly not be good, according to&nbsp;Clayton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She&nbsp;describes that anxiety as “completely natural and probably a good thing,”&nbsp;since some&nbsp;concern&nbsp;helps motivate people&nbsp;to try to do something to stop climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More extreme climate distress can lead to rumination and non-stop thoughts about climate change to the point that&nbsp;a person&nbsp;loses&nbsp;sleep or&nbsp;has&nbsp;trouble concentrating on tasks,&nbsp;Clayton&nbsp;said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They might not be able to engage in normal life activities like enjoying themselves and socializing and spending time with friends and family,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In her book&nbsp;“Generation Dread,”&nbsp;Wray lays out four levels of climate distress: mild, medium,&nbsp;significant&nbsp;and severe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those that suffer from mild eco-anxiety&nbsp;have some feelings of upset,&nbsp;but&nbsp;they “are not constant and can be distracted from.”&nbsp;These people also often believe that “others” have an answer to the climate crises,&nbsp;which helps assuage their concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>People with&nbsp;a&nbsp;“medium”&nbsp;level&nbsp;of eco-anxiety feel upset about climate change more&nbsp;often&nbsp;than those with&nbsp;the&nbsp;mild&nbsp;version&nbsp;and have some doubts about what solutions “others” might have to the climate crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those&nbsp;with “significant” eco-anxiety are upset daily by feelings of&nbsp;“guilt,&nbsp;grief&nbsp;or fear”&nbsp;over climate change and&nbsp;the possibility of&nbsp;social collapse as the result of&nbsp;it,&nbsp;according to the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And like&nbsp;Clayton, Wray describes people with “severe” eco-anxiety as&nbsp;suffering from “intrusive thoughts, poor sleep, and&nbsp;preoccupation with the climate emergency” that prevents them from enjoying life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only about&nbsp;3 percent&nbsp;of the total U.S. population is estimated to suffer from such an extreme level of climate anxiety, according&nbsp;to Yale Program on Climate Change Communication data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Younger people and people of color are more likely to fall within that&nbsp;group, according to Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the&nbsp;program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>And about half of those with&nbsp;that severe&nbsp;eco-anxiety already&nbsp;exhibit&nbsp;“more standard anxiety or depression,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>How to manage climate distress</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>



<p>For those experiencing extreme climate anxiety,&nbsp;Clayton&nbsp;recommends&nbsp;figuring out what triggers those feelings of panic, despair or fear and learning when to&nbsp;withdraw&nbsp;from those&nbsp;situations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe step away from the news,” she said,&nbsp;and instead&nbsp;go for a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;nature or take a few minutes to do a deep-breathing exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wray&nbsp;told The Hill&nbsp;finding&nbsp;support is crucial&nbsp;— for those experiencing any level of climate distress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Find other people who get it and can&nbsp;validate&nbsp;the concerns, that can legitimize the pain a person might be going through&nbsp;and say,&nbsp;'Yeah,&nbsp;I’m worried too,'” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a growing number of resources out there to help people manage their climate distress.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Good Grief Network, a nonprofit organization that runs support groups for eco-distress, even offers a 10-step program&nbsp;to help those overwhelmed by eco-anxiety learn how to&nbsp;cope.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way to manage climate distress is by doing something&nbsp;to help mitigate the effects of climate change, Clayton said,&nbsp;from figuring out how to use less fossil fuels to joining a&nbsp;local environmental activism group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“That,&nbsp;too,&nbsp;will help people feel like they are less like passive victims and more like they have&nbsp;agency,”&nbsp;she&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>
