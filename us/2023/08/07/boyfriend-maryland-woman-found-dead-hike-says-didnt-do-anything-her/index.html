    <p>The new boyfriend of Maryland mother of five Rachel Morin, who was found dead on a hiking trail Sunday, insisted he played no role in her demise after police announced a homicide probe.</p> <p>Richard Tobin, 27, who has a lengthy criminal record, took to Facebook Sunday to shoot down rampant online speculation that he may have been behind her killing.</p> <p>"I love Rachel, I would never do anything to her, let the family and I grieve. Yes I have a past but I also have 15 months clean and have changed as a person. Please," Tobin wrote under his relationship status, which was updated Aug. 1 to reflect that Morin is his girlfriend.</p>  <p>Tobin has prior arrests for malicious destruction of property, criminal second-degree assault, resisting arrest, drug possession, disorderly intoxication and violating restraining orders, according to Maryland court records. </p> <p>He has not been named as a suspect in his girlfriend's death or been accused of any wrongdoing. </p> <p>He reported her missing Saturday at 11:30 p.m. after she didn't return home from a hike on the Ma and Pa Heritage Trail in Bel Air, Maryland – about 30 miles north of Baltimore.</p> <p>She was last seen at home wearing a dark tank top, black spandex shorts and gray sneakers before heading out around 6 p.m.</p> <p>Her car was located at the trailhead's Williams Street entrance and taken to the criminal investigations division for processing, police said.</p> <p>The next day a person called 911 to report finding a woman's body near the trail, which authorities believe is Morin, Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler said at a press conference.</p> <p>"I’m not going to go into what, physically, they observed at the scene. But investigators believe, sadly, that it’s a homicide case," Gahler added.</p> <p>Authorities are awaiting the medical examiner's report for more information, including the cause of death and official confirmation that the body is Morin. </p> <p>"This was not an accidentally [sic] death, and she did not go willingly, and she deserves a funeral worthy of her beauty," wrote her sister, Rebekah Morin, on a GoFundMe page to raise money for her burial.</p> <p>Rachel Morin didn't have life insurance, and any additional funds that are raised will go toward her children, the page says.</p> <p>The devastated sister revealed that the family had suffered another blow a week earlier when their niece, Lily Beth, passed away from SIDS. </p> <p>Rebekah Morin urged anyone who has tips about her sister's death to call the Harford County Sheriff's Office, so the family can "get justice."</p> <p>"Rachel Morin I love you and miss you so much," her sister wrote. "Save a place for me."</p> <p>Richard Tobin couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p> <p><i>Emma Colton contributed to this report.</i></p>
